I am deeply committed to supporting my community by addressing healthcare disparities and advancing opportunities for communities that are underrepresented and under-resourced, more specifically Black and African American people. With disparities in healthcare access, outcomes, and representation persisting as a significant challenge in our society and greater gaps present here in Rochester, I look forward to continuing my education and becoming a part of the solution. </br></br>My primary goal is to become a catalyst for change in medical settings, ensuring that all individuals, regardless of their race, education, socioeconomic status, or other factors, receive the quality healthcare they need and deserve to live healthy lives. This scholarship will greatly support my mission and help to reduce the financial weight of attending college on myself and my mother, who has worked extremely hard to support me throughout my academic, leadership, and community service journeys. </br></br>Overcoming my challenges has helped me grow a deeper passion for learning and helping others. Despite navigating virtual learning during COVID, attending three different high schools, losing a classmate due to gun violence, and other personal hurdles, my dedication to my schoolwork and support for my peers remained constant. Throughout these difficult times, I was able to keep focus and excel in my schoolwork, while balancing work, sports, and community service. I earned numerous honors, including Salutatorian in middle school and the RCSDâ€™s Student-Athlete of the Year award, along with a 4.75 GPA in high school. I'm incredibly grateful for the resources and supports that helped me navigate the different challenges I faced and I seek to always be an advocate for others in similar ways.</br></br>In December, I was accepted to my dream school, Spelman College (also known as the #1 HBCU in the country!), as an Honors Program candidate and I am so excited about the unique opportunity to flourish in an environment that was created for ambitious and community-oriented young Black women students like myself. Having the opportunity to gain knowledge and support from other Black students, staff, and professionals will help to further ignite my passion for healthcare equity and give me a unique educational experience and skills to serve as a healthcare provider in the future while growing as a confident and equipped Black woman. </br></br>Attending college is an essential step in a career in medicine. Attending an HBCU would allow me to focus more on my studies, community involvement, and being an advocate for the Black community. Understanding the funding inequities that HBCUs experience and the difficult choices students have to make to attend, I now more than ever understand the importance of being financially prepared for this journey. This scholarship will greatly support my mission to become a healthcare advocate and leader for my community, as well as support a positive experience during my college years.</br></br>Thank you so much for taking the time to review my application. Receiving this scholarship would not only help reduce the financial burden of attending college but also significantly endorse my commitment to addressing healthcare disparities and advocating for Black and African American communities like ours here in Rochester. With your support, I am looking forward to my journey at Spelman College, where I will be empowered to make a meaningful impact as a future healthcare provider and community leader. Thank you for considering my application and investing in my aspirations to create more equitable and inclusive outcomes for all.</br></br>Thank you,</br>Amirah Cunningham","Childcare and Youth Assistant, Faith Church | 2017 - Present</br></br>Event Volunteer, Faith Church | 2017 - Present </br></br>Volunteer at Black Scholars Event | 2023</br></br>Youth Basketball Assistant Coach | 2022-2023</br></br>Community Beautification Crew Member, Rochester City School District | 2023</br></br>RCSD Student Ambassador | 2022 - 2023</br></br>Volunteer at Lady of Mercy | 2021 </br></br>Babysitter Volunteer, Sojourner Home at Wilson Commencement Park | 2018 - 2019</br></br>Gift of Hope Package Assembler, Rochester Jewels | 2019</br></br>Introduction to Coding Event Volunteer, EagleView Technologies | 2018</br></br>Toy and Coat Drive Volunteer and Greeter, City of Rochester | 2017",James Monroe,2023,4,Yes,No,1270,,,,,Health Science,Physician Assistant,Biology,Physician Assistant,"$50,000 - $100,000",,,0,Spelman College,"350 Spelman Ln SW, Atlanta, GA 30314",Accepted,Morgan State University,"1700 E Cold Spring Ln, Baltimore, MD 21251",Accepted,Addlife,Delta Sigma Theta Maude Orman Memorial Scholarship,"Jack & Jill of America, Inc., Rochester Chapter Scholarship",New Bethel CME Church- Necola T.

Whether itâ€™s excelling academically or taking on positions of leadership or giving back to my community, I strive to demonstrate the importance of hard work, dedication, and service. My journey so far, has been one of growth and academic achievement as I accept challenges and responsibilities.</br></br>From a young age, I have had a thirst for knowledge and a curiosity to explore new ideas. I have consistently challenged myself with difficult courses and have stayed committed to achieving my full potential. Academically, I continue to strive for greatness, gaining honors as Student of the Month, an Urban League of Rochester Black Scholar and induction into the National Honor Society. Engaging in activities such as Math League has allowed me to tackle math problems both on my own and with others. Furthermore, through the Monroe Community College Science and Technology Entry Program, I have visited colleges and participated in creative activities. This allowed me to expand my horizons, and increase my skill set.</br></br>Aside from academics, I have actively participated in leadership roles and community service activities. As an Attendance Clerk in the National Honor Society, I thoroughly tracked attendance and helped the community through multiple volunteer projects. In addition, I have shown my commitment to giving back to the community by helping to plan holiday projects for underprivileged families over Thanksgiving and Christmas as a member of the Service Club. I have also gained beneficial professional experience that has helped me develop essential skills. As a Crew Member at Dunkin' Donuts, I learnt the value of teamwork and customer service, while my time as a Lawn Care Worker with my father taught me the value of hard work and dedication.</br></br>Apart from my other interests, I like helping my father with his roofing company website, which includes managing and creating content to improve its visibility on the internet. Aside from that, I often deal with computer issues for my family members by applying my knowledge of technology to solve problems quickly. Also, I got into the world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) by working on a project for fun. Regardless of my schedule, I have always found time for my hobbies and personal interests. In my spare time, I enjoy playing video games, watching anime and Korean dramas, and spending quality time with my family. As the oldest child in my family, I embrace my leadership responsibilities by continuously setting a good example for my younger siblings while balancing school and home life. </br></br>As I look forward, my goals are clear. I have a passion for technology and a drive to make a positive difference in the world. I am determined to pursue a career in Computer Science with the goal of becoming a Software Engineer. The possibility of using my skills to create new solutions to real-world problems inspires me. With a solid foundation of academic excellence, leadership experience, and a commitment to serve others, I am confident in my ability to achieve my goals and make a positive impact in the world.",November Adopt a Family Holiday Project | 11/30/2022</br>December Adopt a Family Holiday Project | 12/15/2022</br>New York State Indoor Percussion Championships | 04/2/2023</br>High School Career Breakfast | 04/06/2023</br>High School Sweetheart's Dance | 04/21/2023</br>Telescope Night | 04/27/2023</br>Run Monday's | 11/20/2022</br>Mowing Lawns | 08/10/2020</br>Middle School Track Meet | 5/27/2022</br>Ronald McDonald House Community Service | 11/15/2023</br>High School Open House | 09/19/2023</br>Self Care Drive | 12/08/2023</br>November Adopt a Family Holiday Project | 11/30/2023</br>December Adopt a Family Holiday Project | 12/15/2023,Gates-Chili High School,2024,97,No,No,,,,,,Computer Science,Software Engineer,Software Engineering,Website Developer,"$10,000 - $50,000",,,,Rochester Institute of Technology,"1 Lomb Memorial Dr, Rochester, NY 14623",Accepted,,,Click dropdown arrow,"Rochester Institute of Technology William A.

They have fostered my love of the complexities of the natural world and medical studies overall. They've made me want to be an apt student, a conscientious person, and more importantly, an advocate for my community.

If we trust that triumph over an obstacle brings us one step closer to our goal, we can embrace them knowing that the lessons learned will reassure, energize, and prepare us for future success. Being a scholar-athlete comes with a variety of obstacles. The most common and grueling is the unpredictability of adversity. In my case, an injury ambushed me right at the peak of my college recruitment and selection process. I was forced to hastily adjust my goals, expectations, and attitude. Adversity would soon help me realize exactly why my family stressed the importance of academic excellence, contingency, and faith.</br>Like most scholar-athletes a goal of mine is to be recruited by college coaches. In the spring of my junior year, I traveled throughout the midwest for AAU Basketball. My confidence peaked and I was playing my best. I was the leading scorer on my team and was viewed as a leader. Coaches rewarded me for my outstanding performance. I went from being overlooked to finally being recognized. On April 27, 2023, I received the first of several messages from an interested coach. He expressed his interest and wanted to plan a visit. I was ecstatic and fulfilled. The hard work, the long car rides, and tears were finally going to benefit me.</br>For two years straight I was awarded the NYSPHSAA Scholar-Athlete award for having the highest GPA on the team. My family was just as excited for this recognition as they were when I hit game-winning shots. I would soon learn that my academic success would be necessary to secure my athletic future.</br>During an out-of-town tournament, I injured my left wrist and played through the pain. I headed to the doctor when I returned home and I was hit with devastating news: I broke my wrist and needed surgery as soon as possible. The surgery was successful and I began my three-month recovery process. This was the worst possible timing. I was invited to camps and heavily recruited. Unfortunately, I could not attend or compete. Adversity was playing a game against me and winning. Doubt started to settle in and I questioned my ability to play college basketball. However, I didnâ€™t let those thoughts win. I trained hard, strengthened my weaknesses and Iâ€™m on my way to having a successful senior year.</br>The adversity that I faced provided an opportunity to prepare myself for the next chapter of my life. Throughout the course of my recovery, I identified various societal issues within my community and I took action through community service. I was accepted into a minority mentorship program at a prestigious University. I enrolled in a college course to better understand the mysteries of the human mind. Through these experiences, I was able to confirm that, in college, I want to research human behavior and why it changes after traumatic events. Specifically, I would like for my research to suggest neurological and therapeutic solutions that bring tranquility to situations so that healing can begin faster for those who encounter mental, social, or emotional trauma.</br>My time away from basketball turned out to be a good problem. I reimagined my purpose and the impact I can have on my community. Faith helped me believe in myself. Experiences other than basketball educated me on issues faced by the less fortunate and provided an opportunity for me to serve. I learned how to research and present on topics such as diabetes, mental health, and human behavior. I will certainly face additional obstacles in life. However, Iâ€™ve learned that with patience and an open mind toward alternative solutions, I can overcome obstacles and apathy. I am thankful that this triumphant battle gave me the energy and drive to finalize my college selection strategy and provided me the guidance necessary to secure success in the future.",Ronald McDonald House </br>House of Mercy</br>Church of Love Faith Center food pantry,Rush Henrietta High School,2024,89,No,No,,AP World History,,Ap Psychology,,Psychology,Neuropsychologist,,,"$150,000 - $200,000",,,,St. Bonaventure,"3261 W State Rd, Saint Bonaventure, NY 14778",Accepted,Suny Oswego,"7060 State Route 104, Oswego, NY 13126 Â·",Accepted,Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity Inc. | Theta Upsilon Sigma Chapter | Cedric E.

From a young age, both of my parents were in and out of my life because of poor choices they made as both adults and parents. This caused me to constantly be passed around from family to family until my early teens, when I was placed in a shelter for a month or 2. I then transitioned into foster care. In foster care I began feeling alienated, like I didn't belong anywhere. This made me angry and that anger got me into trouble, not only at home but in school as well. At the beginning of my 8th grade year I was put in a residential facility for troubled youth. Being in the system and being placed in a facility really made me feel alone. I went through a load of emotions being there. Finally, it took my fatherâ€™s death for me to begin getting my life together for the better.</br></br>My story isnâ€™t uncommon, but thatâ€™s not what itâ€™s about, itâ€™s about the outcome. I grew up in crime and poverty where both of these are normalized, where the adults near me didnâ€™t have a diploma, where they sold drugs or stole from stores to make a living. I could have walked that path, but then I would be a failure like them. When I was angry I used to black out a lot and say things I didnâ€™t mean, and one day my aunt told me something I would never forget â€œitâ€™s either your going to get hurt or your going to get someone hurtâ€ and I didnâ€™t want either. I wanted to be better than the community I grew up in and better than my family. So me being an athlete and going to college is paving that road to success.</br>Once you have been through so much in life, sometimes it's hard to recognize the bad habits you fixed or the things you actually learned from an obstacle, a challenge you endured. I learned from the obstacles I went through, one thing I learned was the way your journey or your story started doesnâ€™t necessarily mean thatâ€™s where it ends. I can turn a bad situation into a good situation with time, effort and dedication. Once I committed to â€œwanting betterâ€ I faced even more challenges; I learned the more you fight to better yourself you will face obstacles again but you can use the challenges you already faced to help you with the challenges you face in life itself and youâ€™ll realize itâ€™s just a bump in the road. Now I am in foster care. I play sports such as football, wrestling, and track. Wrestling was more for me because of the mentality needed to become a wrestler and the support I received not only from coaches but from players as well. Wrestling helped me want to become better every time I stepped on the mat, trying to become 1% better each time. As I began getting somewhat better I decided I wanted to pursue the sport in college. I believe with wrestling and the obstacles I overcame I can pave a road to success and pursue those dreams I have by still learning and becoming 1% better each day.",N/A,Rush Henrietta High School,2024,85,No,No,,,,,,Exercise Science,personal/athletic trainer,kinesiology,physical therapist,"$10,000 - $50,000",,,,Brockport,,Accepted,N/A,"Monroe Ave, Brockport, NY 14420",Click dropdown arrow,ESL Charitable Foundation Scholarship*,MAR Foundation Scholarship*,Addlife,Excellus Blue Cross Blue Shield Community Excellence Scholarship*,SUNY Brockport Foundation Urban League of Rochester Scholarship*,Youth for Youth Foundation Scholarship,Little Anderson Morgan Scholarship*,Jacelyn Fletcher,jfletcher@rhnet.org,English teacher,john delvicio,jdelvicio@rhnet.org,business teacher,,N/A,N/A

Like everywhere else on the earth there is some sort of conflict lurking around. My upbringing was interesting. One side of my family was poor while the other was better off, So I have lived through both sides and I have seen many things because of that.</br></br>My mother is a very generous and kind person. She helped those who were in need even when she was in need herself. I admired and looked up to her because, in my younger mind, she was making friends wherever she went. So as I grew up I decided to follow in her footsteps and be as kind and generous as humanly possible.</br></br>I saw people hurt each other, from strangers all the way to close family members. They all hurt each other for their own personal gain. Could I believe that? Getting hurt by my own family? I would always ponder on what could drive someone to do that. And then I realized that there just isnâ€™t enough love and compassion in the world.</br></br>I continued to stay true to myself, I try to be as kind and compassionate to everyone even those who oppose and hate me. At times it is risky, you never can truly know someone's intentions but I think it is worth the risk to show someone that there is more to life than just being angry and hateful. The world can only be changed through love. All those who tried to change it by forceful means through dictation and fear failed in the end. But we have seen that time and time again showing true compassion and kindness can change the world for the better.</br></br>I will always go out of my way to help someone no matter how troubled they are.

Your actions significantly affect your life and take time away that will never return. Now, Iâ€™ve learned to take everything I do with a grain of salt and I hate wasting time. There will always be things in your life that you can do that can make time seem to move at twice the speed, and for me, that would be working out. This activity alone can make time irrelevant. It holds a special place in my heart mainly because it provides my mind with a friendly, safe place to relax and release any stress that has been contained from within. We all have days where we just feel so bad, and not everyone has someone to talk to, and in those stressful moments, people often find themselves in holes of addiction that lead to drugs and depression.</br>My passion for the gym and working on my body all derived from pain inflicted by others, I was tired of being looked down upon as some weak link. This is when I made the</br></br>choice to start using the gym as a way to help me through hard times and it has become a great part of my life ever since. As time eventually moved on, I started to do some more research on my own. This included how to build more muscle and all that jazz.

It gave me a very important mindset that I've been living my life by one phrase and one phrase alone, â€œHard work beats talentâ€. This alone was able to carry me through all of the times I genuinely felt like giving up or quitting. This doesn't mean there were never times where I felt discouraged or unmotivated but in those moments I always turned towards my family obviously since they are the closest people I have around. Although they say what I want to hear their words often aren't able to really connect with my soul, more often than not, I find the words of Kevin Levrone a World Class Bodybuilder to connect with me the most. His words and his quotes mirror the ideals I hold close to my heart. He often along with others preached the idea that you should always follow your dreams and goals that you set for yourself and also to educate yourself on the goals you set so that reaching them becomes inevitable.</br>I think of the gym as a sword I use to sharpen my body, mind and also my soul. Whether it be at home, school, or wherever it may be I always push myself to do something, anything of that matter, no matter how little it may be. At the end of it all, the more consistent you are, the more committed you will turn out to be. That's how you develop proper discipline and integrity. Thatâ€™s why I go to the gym. Now with all of that said why does this matter and how is it relevant to what I want to do now well, throughout this whole essay I kept bringing up one key factor that being discipline and integrity. These two things</br>Your Last Name 2</br></br>when executed correctly can help one become unstoppable and that's what it has done for me. All of my success and future success all derives from those aspects I have built within me overtime.

Cue explosions. Cue timely rescue. Cue the happily ever after or mysteriously unanswered plot point. And cue the sounds of cooking in the kitchen and the white noise of the radio channel on my dad's phone. Sent back to reality, I place the finished book down on the tabletop from my place on the couch.</br></br></br>Reading has encompassed my entire life. It's my biggest hobby. As with most things, my mother was the one to stoke that fire. Reading material filled the laundry room's shelf and the bedrooms of my sister and me, courtesy of my parents. Walking to the local library was one of the biggest constants in my life, so you could say I'm always used to having a book around. From suspenseful mysteries to graphic novels and manga to classic adventure stories, I would always have something to dive into and get lost in. Reading was a way to escape daily life, and the mundane or stressful moments. These characters and their adventures, where they fought insecurities, sea monsters, or maniacal villains seeking world dominance, would fight for my attention after school. Going through ups and downs, they'd eventually defeat what was standing in their way, finding THE END after neatly tying up any unresolved issues. Their stories would jump from the pages and come alive in my mind. I would more often than not find myself lost in my head, making up my own character interactions and story arcs, mulling over awesome powers and new-age technology, and thinking about how cool it would be to have the skills or abilities they demonstrated.</br></br></br>That enthusiasm would spread and form other interests. A Scholastic book fair in elementary school would lead to me unknowingly buying a Sonic the Hedgehog character guide. It wasn't much as reading material, but the 10-year-old version of me would spend many an afternoon copying artwork from their page to my own before proudly placing it in a folder I would keep in my room. When I received a sketchbook as a gift for Christmas, it only gave me more inspiration. Drawing was an opportunity to physically display my enthusiasm for a character or series, be it from a book or TV show. It was a hobby that was difficult and time-consuming, but rewarding. It's what I managed to cultivate all on my own back then, which is why I'm proud of my ability. </br></br></br>So yes, daydreaming is a staple of my life. And that's what makes fiction entertaining: imagination. It's what gives life to each drawing I create from scratch and to stories that have never really happened. It makes life brighter. Daydreaming over fiction doesn't mean that reality is inferior; it enhances it. Because humans have imagination, we can come up with possibilities. And haven't those possibilities only benefited us? From automobiles to solar panels to streaming services, imagination has led to innovation. We all have that spark, and letting it burn freely is something everyone should embrace. Limitless imagination leads to limitless potential, so as long as I can think and dream, I can grow and thrive.",East Rochester Cafeteria Overseeing - May 2022 - June 2022</br>Equicenter Farms - 8/15/23 - 8/30/23,Rush Henrietta High School,2024,96,Yes,No,1380,World History,3,US History,5,Undecided,Health / Biomedical Sciences,Environmental Science,STEM,"$10,000 - $50,000",,,EFC is N/A,RIT,"1 Lomb Memorial Dr, Rochester, NY 14623",Accepted,Nazareth,"4245 East Avenue, Rochester, NY 14618",Accepted,Delta Sigma Theta Maude Orman Memorial Scholarship,Excellus Blue Cross Blue Shield Community Excellence Scholarship*,"Jack & Jill of America, Inc., Rochester Chapter Scholarship","Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority, Inc., Romunda Harris-Fonville Scholarship*",Youth for Youth Foundation Scholarship,Clifford B.

On April 1, 2005, my mother moved to America, leaving behind her life as she knew it. She was a smart woman who graduated from college and opened her own business in her home country, but much of that didnâ€™t matter here. This, along with the language barrier, was a huge setback for her. On March 11, 2006, I was born, and this marked a significant turning point in our lives. At this time my father was the primary breadwinner of the family because my mother couldnâ€™t get a decent job since she didnâ€™t speak English. Yet, this did not discourage her. My mother enrolled in English and in the dental hygiene program at Monroe Community College. I remember watching her studying in the living room, spending hours on an assignment ensuring she fully understood her work. My motherâ€™s diligence resulted in her graduating with distinction. To this day, my mom is one of the most loved and appreciated dental hygienists. My mother demonstrated how determination can get you far in life. Having witnessed this at a young age has always motivated me to do well in school. I fell in love with math and science and shared my mother's passion for learning. As a timid child, I expressed myself through extracurriculars. At 10, I joined the Rush Henrietta Falcons soccer team and began competing in gymnastics. My parents always supported me in the decisions I made, making it easy for me to explore what I loved. Participating in sports also kept me busy as a child making me competitive and persistent. Once I got to middle school, my competitiveness began to show in my academics as I strived to be the best in everything I did. This was the age when I also began to take my sports seriously. My father convinced me to try track and field and I instantly fell in love with the sport. I found sprinting to be a great way for me to express myself. As mentioned previously, my parents were extremely supportive of me; but because I am the only child of my parents, there were times when feeling alone was difficult. As I approached high school, my endeavor to do well in school started to consume my thoughts. Receiving good grades began to feel like a game, and if I werenâ€™t winning, stress would take over. I realized I was underestimating myself intellectually. After speaking with my friends and family about the way I felt, they all convinced me that they were proud of me regardless of my achievements. I spent more time with friends and family and being on the track. By my sophomore year of high school, I outgrew my timidity and became more open-minded. I truly began to excel in track and field. I participated in the 55, 100, and 200-meter dashes and the 4 x 100 and 200-meter relays. My relay team qualified for the Nike Indoor Nationals meet that year to place 6th. I even won the Most Valuable Female Track Athlete award. By my outdoor season, I knew I wanted to pursue track and field in college. I spent that summer training and working on my speed endurance to prepare for my junior season. I also spent that summer volunteering around my community, using the hours to count towards the National Honor Society, which I was inducted into early in my junior year. Now that I am a senior, I realize that my life has taught me to be independent, diligent, and genuine. I will forever be proud and grateful for the obstacles my mother faced and that I can use her experience as an example for my life.","Henrietta Public Library - 444-2306, 1 hour 8/27/22, </br>Elizabeth Daycare - 168 Wildbriar Road - (585) 355-3097 8/29/22 - 9/2/22 24 hours </br>University of Rochester â€œFriends of Strongâ€ - 21.85 hours, Summer 2023",Rush Henrietta High School,2024,90,No,No,,AP Calculus AB,,,,Biology,Physical Therapy,,Physician Assistant,"$150,000 - $200,000",,,,SUNY University at Albany,"1400 Washington Ave, Albany, NY 12222",Accepted,Hampton University,"100 E Queen St, Hampton VA 23669",Accepted,"Sigma Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc., Gamma Iota Boule Foundation Scholarship*",Christensen Daniels Scholarship*,"Sisters for a Better Black Community, Inc.

I dislike that they run out of ink, I dislike the smell and worst of all I hate how the ink can stain your hands. Why canâ€™t we all just use pencils forever? Sure we have to sharpen them, but we have mechanical pencils. Most importantly pencils mask our embarrassment, our mistakes-- things we donâ€™t want people to see-- pencils are just perfect. My obsession with pencils may be linked to my desire for perfectionism, which has held me back from opportunities in my school community as well as struggles with my own personal development. </br></br>As a kid I was always willing to learn new skills; not just learn but master them. As a kid I often stood in the kitchen with my mom while she cooked. I learned to cut onions and not cry, and never to face the pot handle on the outside. I knew how to reset the computer when my parents couldnâ€™t figure out what was wrong. I was the child they called on for everything, I felt like a star; I was the perfect child. This mindset followed me all through elementary school, so much that I sacrificed my nap time to dedicate that time to my handwriting book. Through middle school I studied for exams over hanging out with friends. I avoided joining any extracurriculars because I knew that academic validation brought me and my parents joy. I wanted to live, breathe, and eat being the best at everything. </br></br>Now, this is not to be mistaken with arrogance, because I knew I wasnâ€™t the best, rather I aimed to be. But this craving completely stunned my development. The majority of the time I didnâ€™t meet the high standards Iâ€™d set for myself, constantly filling my head with negative thoughts even though in reality I was in fact doing better than most of my peers.</br></br>When I entered high school there were so many new faces, so many opportunities to form new friendships, and I took advantage of that. I began to interact with new people, I saw my friends outside of school, and I even got a job, which woke me out of the dream that my life mission was to be perfect. The overachieving high standards Iâ€™d set for myself limited me from actually doing my best. Sure, I excelled academically but books and high numbers wasnâ€™t everything there was to life. I had to learn how to take care of myself. In an effort to boost my morale and confidence I had to set aside being perfect. I knew I wanted to attend college, and there was absolutely no way I was going to be the best by living in solitary. What could an academically strong student like me offer to a college if I wasnâ€™t willing to embrace my extroverted persona? Although growing out of my shell took many years of realization and reflection, it's allowed me to learn more deeply about myself. Oh, yeah. I also learned that pens arenâ€™t as bad as I thought.","Henrietta ReStore- Summer of '23</br></br>National Honor Society Henrietta Rec Center (Holiday Events/ Donation Drives)-</br>2/12/22, 2/8/23 12/9/22, 12/9/23,",Rush Henrietta High School,2024,92,No,No,,AP World History,4,AP Chemistry,3,Chemistry,Orthodontist,Biology,Orthodontist,"$50,000 - $100,000",,,,SUNY Cortland,"22 Graham Ave, Cortland, NY 13045",Accepted,University of Connecticut,"Storrs, CT 06269",Accepted,Christensen Daniels Scholarship*,ESL Charitable Foundation Scholarship*,Excellus Blue Cross Blue Shield Community Excellence Scholarship*,Fletcher & Mildred Smith Memorial Scholarship*,"Jack & Jill of America, Inc., Rochester Chapter Scholarship",Manhattan Golf Club Scholarship*,"Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc., Theta Alpha Zeta Chapter Scholarship",Adam Herbert,Aherbert@elderwood.com,"Adam was my former boss, and we worked together in dining services for 4 months at a retirement home. </br>His phone number is 585-775-8738",Rosaria LiVecchi,rlivecchi@rhnet.org,Former teacher of 3 years.,,7,1

Years later, I attended</br>elementary school, I made friends, but not the kind of people you would want to be your friend. I</br>would let my Â¨friendsÂ¨ walk all over me after they would make fun of me and I wouldnÂ´t stand up</br>for myself. I didnÂ´t think that what I had to say mattered.

This means that I still wasnÂ´t the person I wanted myself</br>to be.Â Â </br>In 10th grade, the very first year in senior high school, I was the same person that I was</br>in Junior High.

Meaning the light we see at this moment was created seventeen years ago. For me, that star marks my beginning. Wolf 359 is eight light-years away; eight years ago, I began to delve into my love for constructing systems and problem-solving when putting together Kâ€™nex toys. Proxima Centauriâ€”four light-years awayâ€”is when I realized what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. Quite a statement for a thirteen-year-old, but I remain determined and unchanged to this day. I want to be an aerospace engineer. It combines my fascination for building, problem-solving, and the exploration of space. The fact that today, I can look up and observe my whole journey mapped out in the light of the stars is captivating. Yet, I am only a few stars into creating my full constellation.</br>While it may seem odd, my room also creates its own miniature universe, documenting my life. On my wall, I have posters of literature, movies, and music that resonate with me; sticky notes, and torn-out notebook paper with half-complete thoughts impulsively written out at 2 a.m. Awards are tacked to the wall, slightly crooked. Pinned above my bed are cut-out pieces of the best lines from my favorite books, confetti from my first concert, and on my ceiling, plastic glow-in-the-dark stars that have been there since my family moved years prior. Even though my walls may exude chaos, they compile who I am; when I look around, everything appears cohesive. Itâ€™s the same way space is chaotic, nevertheless, there is a structure to how it unfolds. One element of my room is that it is a graveyard of past interests; however, they still inspire present ones. Often, when considering the various activities I have delved into throughout my life, I wonder if there's a point to all the minute stars that had a vast impact on who I am. Yet, when I look around my room at the violin case, black belt, or deck of cards, I realize every interest left me with something important I still carry. The violin allowed me to play the piano easier when I decided that after eight years, I wanted to switch. Taekwondo instilled a certain form of discipline that has made me persistent, and magic taught me how to be a captivating storyteller. Photography shows me how to appreciate the little things that often go unnoticed. Cross country left me with lifelong friends, and drawing proved invaluable during the design process when engineering a new system. Two pursuits consistently stuck with me throughout my weaving interests and eventful life: my love for designing and problem-solving. This all came full circle a few months prior when I was presenting one of my designs at a science fair. The keynote speaker handed us each a plastic, sticky, glow-in-the-dark star; the same ones Iâ€™ve had on my ceiling all these years. The fake stars that represent the real ones, like Proxima Centauri, continue to inspire me to build my own knowledge of the universe.

Who am I? Am I white or black? What should I act like? And my answers to those questions shaped who I am today. We are a product of our environment. The people we hang around, the people we choose not to hang around, our parents, our income, our homelife, culture, etc. Every little thing plays a role. </br>When I heard a fourth grade peer say that word, â€œwhitewashed,â€ a million things flew through my head. I started to question myself. My father is black, but my mother is white. My dad has been absent most of my life, so there's not much recollection of him from the time. That left me being raised by my mother alone. She is very very open-minded and taught me a lot about my culture, but the topic of race, and racial stereotypes, was not something I had problems with or had to worry about until this was said to me; being in a very diverse district afforded me the opportunity to be surrounded by all ethnicities and cultures</br>I definitely wouldnâ€™t say Iâ€™ve faced a lot of racism in my life. My main issue lies in figuring out what I really am. In middle school and elementary school, it was obvious what certain parents were telling their kids. Questions like â€œWhy arenâ€™t you white then?â€ or â€œAre you adopted?â€ would be asked when other kids were confused about my skin color after only seeing my mom. I think theyâ€™re all reasonable questions to be asked, given their knowledge and the situation. </br>But they began to make me wonder, too. As I got older, different questions became more prominent, like â€œWhy do you act so white?â€ and â€œWow, youâ€™re actually taking the notes, white ass.â€ These were naturally more insulting and concerning, but out of all these normal issues a lot of people face, one that really struck me was the idea of â€œacting whiteâ€ or â€œacting like a race.â€ Until I understood common stereotypes, none of this would have made any sense to me. </br>I hated it. I would sometimes act a certain way just because I thought I had to because I am half black. Other times, Iâ€™d do the complete opposite because Iâ€™m just as white as I am black. I would hang out with different groups of people, trying to figure out where I fit in based on who I was â€œsupposedâ€ to be around. Nothing made sense to me. I donâ€™t believe your race should dictate how a person behaves at all, yet it had a major impact on my adolescence. </br>There is nobody youâ€™re â€œsupposed to be.â€ You are who you are, and that's final. Weâ€™re more than our parents' kids; weâ€™re more than our race; weâ€™re more than our grades; and weâ€™re definitely more than social constructs that make us who people think we are.

Church is the center of Ethiopian Orthodox culture, and since my childhood, Iâ€™ve resented it. When I was nine, I shoved into deaconship, due to my motherâ€™s insistence and followed through with it every Sunday. The commitment to obtaining deaconship was hard but I pummeled through all the training-countless hours of memorizing Geâ€™ez and Amharic, ancient languages in Ethiopia, vocal training, and scripture practice. I became a youth leader, preaching to churchgoers and leading services. But the service I provided never enthused my heart. As an Ethiopian diaspora born in Rochester, New York, I have felt somewhat resentful towards my culture and community. Being thrusted into deaconship tore me between two cultures, my American culture and my foreign yet familiar Ethiopian Orthodox one. With each â€œtenseiâ€ from the priest, my knees buckled and ached - none of my non-Ethiopian friends went to church or were forced to be deacons; it was not fair. Every Sunday, I would fight my mom, begging her not to make me go, but each morning she would not relent, insisting I just did not understand how important this was for me. So, I continued to go, halfheartedly preaching and sharing Godâ€™s will to elderly churchgoers who clasped their hands and prayed with all their hearts. </br>On August 20th, 2020, my sister called me upstairs. She told me the mortifying newsâ€“our uncle had died from gunfire during Ethiopiaâ€™s ongoing gruesome war. Suddenly, I heard a psychotic echoing wail. In an instant, I rushed upstairs, my heart plummeted with dread. I saw my mother on the ground rolling, banging her fists on the ground, crying and yelling, â€œWONDEMEI,â€ my brother in Amharic. Her grief consumed her - suffering on her own, isolated from her family in Ethiopia due to Covid-19 restrictions and the war. It was a difficult sight to see, I was unsure how to grieve, or help her grieve. I recall wondering, why couldnâ€™t I help when it matters the most? My internal conflict surrounding my deaconship felt minimal in comparison to my motherâ€™s wails that echoed our home for weeks. Yet, through all of this, she continued to stand strong at church with the other churchgoers, as if she was a pillar that could not be knocked down. </br>Making personal connections are essential to personal growth - whether itâ€™s storytelling from our families, history lessons from our teachers, or conversations with friends. These conversations and connections we make push you forward in your future and direct you on a path. Thus, the future you want strives behind the people you surround yourself with. When my mother had forced me into deaconship, this is what she had intended: to foster a relationship and to create a connection with her homeland thousands of miles away. Though I was too naive to understand it at nine, I want to continue fostering these connections with my culture with my community of Ethiopian diaspora on college campuses as well and create shared spaces online and in-person. My first experiences with coding began in my AP Computer Science, creating projects and learning the basics to programming. With an advanced college degree, I would be able to put my personal experiences and learned skills to use to create shared spaces for diaspora around the world, who experienced the same internal conflict with their culture as I did. </br>Now, as I countdown to my final weeks of deaconship at my church, my knees donâ€™t ache when the priest calls us to stand. The disconnection I felt when preaching before has withered away. I realized that no matter what happens, we should stand up and move forward. Being a deacon changed my life completely. Along with the service, the community relationships I fostered, there is nothing I would change from those experiences that allowed for me to develop into the young scholar I am today.",Volunteered at my church 5 hours a week since 9th grade</br>Guided kids to better themselves at camp</br>Teach kids soccer and football every wednesday and saturday from january 12th</br>Tutor my cousins,Rush Henrietta High School,2024,90,No,No,,,,,,Computer Science,Undecided,Business,Undecided,"$50,000 - $100,000",,,N/A,undecided,N/A,Application Submitted,Undecided,N/A,Application Submitted,"Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc.

The year was 2020, and having just completed my eighth-grade online class for the day, I found myself reflecting on the drastic shift in my routine. Removed from the traditional school setting a couple of months ago, my days had transformed into a monotonous cycle of waking up at nine am for online classes followed by hours immersed in video games, extending into the night. The toll on my health was evident, both physically and mentally, as I realized I had gained more weight in this short period than I had ever imagined.</br></br>As I contemplated going upstairs for another gaming session, a pivotal moment occurred. My dad, about to go downstairs into the basement gym for a workout, inspired a sudden realization. I needed to prioritize my health, and the opportunity to join him in exercising was too significant to ignore. Quickly changing into gym attire, I hurried to the basement, where the faint hum of the air conditioner greeted me with a cold breeze, mixing with the distinct scents of the gym equipment and rusted weights.</br></br>Anxiety set in as I faced the unknown, having never lifted weights before. The fear of injuring myself was clear. As I entered the gym, the anticipation on my father's face was evident. I asked if I could join him, and he suggested a total body workout for my first day, promising a slow start. Little did I know, he had deceived me.</br></br>The following hour and a half turned out to be one of the most challenging workouts of my life. Weighted squats, leg extensions, bench presses, dumbbell rows, and pull-downs pushed me to the brink. Dizzy and sweating profusely, I staggered back upstairs, collapsing on the couch in sheer exhaustion. It was then, after catching my breath, that the realization struck meâ€”my extreme fatigue was a reflection of being vastly out of shape. In clear contrast, my father, seemingly unfazed, treated it as just another workout.</br></br>In that pivotal moment, a commitment to change ignited within me. Recognizing the poor state of my health, I pledged to change my daily routine and diet. Week after week, without fail, I embraced the challenge of working out at least three times. Through perseverance the extreme workouts, once daunting, gradually became my norm.</br></br>Simultaneously, I improved my eating habits, limited my excessive use of video games, and embraced a more structured sleep schedule. These choices carved out a path to a healthier, more balanced life. Within a year of devoted commitment to this new schedule, the results spoke volumesâ€”I shed 30 pounds and found a passion I had never experienced before.</br></br>This journey wasn't just about physical transformation; it was a lesson in personal growth. Each workout, every dietary choice, and my decision to prioritize health were stepping stones toward a better version of myself. A lifestyle that once seemed difficult to follow, had become a testament to resilience, teaching me that positive change is not just achievable but sustainable through deliberate, persistent efforts. This journey taught me that by making adjustments to my routine, tackling challenges, and committing to personal growth, anything is possible.",RH Food Pantry 2021 - 2024</br>Teen Book Festival 2021,Rush Henrietta High School,2024,95,No,No,N/A,AP Calculus,N/A,AP Physics AB,N/A,Pre-Med,anesthesiologist,engineering physics,physician,"$200,000 and above",,,,RIT,"1 Lomb Memorial Dr, Rochester, NY 14623",Accepted,Suny Binghamton,"4400 Vestal Pkwy E, Binghamton, NY 13902",Accepted,Addlife,AKOMA Nona Patterson Chambers Scholarship,"Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.

I am also looking forward to studying abroad and interning during my time in higher education. I have two younger siblings that are involved in many activities like me from sports all the way to music. My Nigerian parents have sacrificed so much to get us where we are today despite having to work from morning to night. While they deal with that plus having to keep up with the bills and costs around the house, applying to scholarships will at least help to ease the financial burden of having to pay for my college tuition. At face value I am a reserved and quiet individual, but those who know me, know that as a resilient and focused young lady, I exhibit all the qualities of great leadership, adequate academics and a commitment to community service which in all makes me an amazing fit as a recipient of this scholarship. </br>Concerning my family background and how it has affected my future goals, my Nigerian family is full of people involved in STEM ranging from nurses in the medical field to biotechnologists for vaccine companies such as Pfizer. My mom is a Nurse Practitioner and my dad is a LPN. While growing up, I have observed their dedication and prudency when it came to nursing and the sacrifices they committed not only to care for us but others as well. Musically speaking, my dad would always put on the radio whenever we went on simple errand runs when I was younger; I and my siblings would scream the lyrics to a Bruno Mars song and my mom would put on K-Love, a christian radio station, on our drives to church. My parents, family members and teachers always encouraged me to continue what I was doing and to get better when it came to concerts, musicals and solos- driving my musical inclination. In turn, they, as well as the rest of my family, have heavily inspired me to continue into the world of STEM as well as music, practically the only worlds I know. But recently, I've come to understand that in the realm of science, just like in life, embracing one's unique characteristics and perspectives is essential for growth and innovation. For years, I always had trouble making friends and constantly found myself alone. Eventually, the books I read, the shows I watched and STEM became that solace in being alone. Delving into STEM topics or research gives me a piece of mind and develops a world where I can focus on myself and myself alone, and it is clear science in any aspect or presented in any form provides that for me. In conclusion, I am confident I can achieve my aspirations in the STEM world because it is in my daily life. From books to shows and even family. Not only do I excel in all my science, technology and music classes, but I genuinely enjoy that escape and joy it provides me. And knowing that about a field I am aspiring towards in the future, only solidifies the hard work I will put into my future Biochemistry and Music Performance career.","Link Crew: August 2022-present, R-H Food Pantry September 2022, Student Tutoring Association:2021-2022, Faith Church: August 2022-present, Tri-M Honor Society September 2022",Rush Henrietta High School,2024,95,Yes,No,1230,AP U.S History,4,AP Chemistry,3,Biochemistry,Pharmacologist,Environmental Science,Environmental Toxicologist,"$200,000 and above",,,,University of Rochester,"Rochester, New York",Accepted,SUNY BInghamton University,"Binghamton, New York",Accepted,Christensen Daniels Scholarship*,"Yellow Tea Rose Foundation, Inc. | Sigma Gamma Rho","Sigma Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc., Gamma Iota Boule Foundation Scholarship*",William McKnight Memorial Scholarship / Nixon Peabody LLP / Rochester Area Community Foundation (April 8),"Sisters for a Better Black Community, Inc.

Iâ€™ve had quite a few experiences that represent this quote. But the one that led to the most perturbed era of my life was the passing of my father.</br>Despite his callus field of work in masonry, he was always gentle with us. Heâ€™d bring us late-night treats that consisted of drumsticks and wings no matter how tired he was or how long the commute would be. I can vividly recount day trips to Niagara Falls, mixing concrete together, and him sitting through countless talentless plays and musicals fighting his own heavy eyelids. He never once raised his voice in the 15 years he helped raise my brothers and me. </br>After January 31st I would never hear him use his voice ever again. </br>I sat on the edge of my auntâ€™s bed in the midst of the night as I listened to my uncle discover my fatherâ€™s body over the phone. I watched the way my brother and auntâ€™s face contorted in agony, while each crevice of their face was illuminated by the blue light emitted from the TV. I wailed and pleaded to hear my fatherâ€™s voice on the other line but it never came. His soft-spoken words of â€˜stay focusedâ€™ never reached my eardrums. As I waited every day for the melodic vibrations of his voice I slowly drove myself to insanity. This monumental event led to my own personal vanquish. </br></br>My grades had faltered and his death took a heavy toll on my mental health. I began 10th grade with a newfound tenacity that was incited by the encouragement of the people around me but finished with 3 incomplete courses and heavily regretted defacements. This experience has permanently altered the way I form relationships and retain them. </br>I grieve the death of loved ones before they even die. Often when I'm holding a conversation I disassociate and imagine how much I'm going to miss them when they pass regardless of their age. I analyze every feature of their face, their voice, and personalities in fear that any day they may draw their last breath. I hang onto peopleâ€™s sentences and partake in their hobbies because I know that one day I'll never hear them speak again or be able to see them do what makes them happy. </br>Despite this hardship, I have overcome adversity and see the world in a whole new light that my father has ignited for me. Iâ€™ve joined programs such as the Civil Air Patrol, 1st Amendment 1st Vote, and African American Leadership League in the hopes of improving my own community just as my father did. Iâ€™ve joined the National Honor Society, been awarded Student of the Year, promoted to First Sergeant, achieved the rank of Chief in CAP, and I'm in the 2nd decile of my graduating class. </br>The most important thing that I've gotten out of this experience that no academic award will ever teach me is that I should cherish every moment that I have with my loved ones; good or bad. We only have such a finite amount of time in this world and a majority of it shouldn't be spent worrying about meaningless things. Always live in the moment because it will become a memory all too fast, whether you like it or not. </br>My father always joked about not living long enough to see me graduate and I always rejected the idea, but I still do.

Whether itâ€™s the fear of a spider crawling up your leg, the fear of looking down while placed high above the world, or even the fear of what may come to our beings after succumbing to the hands of death, everyone experiences it. When it comes down to me though, itâ€™s much more different than what one may think. What I fear is words, something difficult to be feared of.</br></br>When I was a child, I spoke a lot. Most of the time without any thought, but I enjoyed projecting my words and language out into the world for others to hear. This has caused issues with me in the classroom and certain adults in my life at the time. As I grew up, I was told to silence myself, either because I was a â€œdisruptionâ€ to the classroom, my tone disguised itself as â€œtalking backâ€ despite it not being my intention, I wasnâ€™t able to identify and change my volume, or a mixture of other reasons. It wasnâ€™t just people attempting to silence me that contributed to my fear, it was myself as well. I had always struggled with the pronunciation of my wording and often stumbled over my phrases, resulting in a festering sense of paranoia deep within my body. Then eventually in middle school, I fell silent.</br></br>It wasnâ€™t exactly complete silence though. I was still able to talk to family, friends, teachers, and whoever when necessary. Still, nonetheless, my speech was limited. Depending on who it was, my speech was kept short and simple, making sure that I could get my point across. But in the end, I would always resume back to my sphere of quietness and solitude. Did I want this? Not at all. Every noise I made struck an overwhelming fright, a fright that caused me to worry about everything that my voice did wrong. And even the simplest things such as presentations, asking for assistance, and making friends became such an obstacle for me to overcome. I wasnâ€™t sure how to overcome this hurdle; the hurdle of words developing into a nightmare.</br></br>Communication is a requirement for success though, isnâ€™t it? If this dread is impairing me so substantially, how am I supposed to reach for the greatest version of myself? After years of struggle, losing battles to anxiety over and over again, I realized a solution was in front of me the entire time. It was something that at a young age the grown-ups in my life had taught me how to do, which would stick with me for the rest of I was living and breathing on Earth. It was writing. </br></br>Sure, Iâ€™m not William Shakespeare or Langston Hughes in terms of skill, but I still take pride in my way with the pen and the paper. With writing, my words are effective and able to get my words across without the worry of stuttering or booming loudness that could disrupt others, and Iâ€™m able to express myself properly without the fear of messing up. Writing allows me to retrace and fix my mistakes, while giving me the time to think carefully about what words I want to say, which is nothing like speaking to me. Though, nothing will compare to the ease of verbal communication, and Iâ€™m still constantly challenging myself to grow comfortable with verbalization. So until I reach my flourishing self, my hands will fight against my anguish and speak words for me when my voice is unable to make a peep.",,Rush Henrietta High School,2024,84,No,No,,,,,,,,,,"$50,000 - $100,000",,,,Monroe Community College,"1000 E Henrietta Rd, Rochester, NY 14623",Accepted,,,Click dropdown arrow,"Sisters for a Better Black Community, Inc.

Music has been a factor in reaching my feelings when I cannot express them aloud to people. Music has been the backbone throughout my whole life. Life without music would be hard for me. It has helped throughout school and with situations throughout my life. Music really helps to motivate me to keep on going no matter what life throws at me. I think of music as a partner in my life.</br></br>Growing up, I used to sit right behind my dad as he magically played the organ at church. I was so captivated by the different melodies and chord progressions he used throughout different songs. The organ would create a nice pad sound filling up the church. I could feel the reverberation through my little body. Every Sunday, there I was behind him, watching and listening to him play. It was then and there that I truly wanted to become a musician and study music. When I was 7, I was gifted my first keyboard. Playing the keyboard became a special hobby that I developed throughout the years. When I play the keyboard, it just reinforces my love for music. I always turned to my dad as a music guide. Receiving general ideas from him helps me branch out my own ideals. Whether I was working on schoolwork or just chilling at home, music was constantly in my head all the time. From my adolescent years up until now, music is like breathing to me.</br></br>I strongly think that music can correlate to peopleâ€™s lives. That is why there are so many genres that exist. There will be certain genres that appeal to different individuals and that help to tell their life stories. No matter what the feeling is, the music just shows it.</br></br>Music can swiftly take me back to my old memories like a time machine. It has made me reflect on the life I have gone through and what I have gained or lost from life. I can fantasize about a lot just by listening to music.</br></br>Music is very powerful and hugely impacts my life. I want to be a music educator because it would show much appreciation and respect for my love for music. I consider music a second language. There are many elements of music, so learning something new about it every day is never boring.</br></br>The skills and traits that I possess to become a successful music educator are creativity, a calm state of mind, and a strong music education. Creativity, being used in a school for example, is beneficial for the students because it keeps them interested. Of course, the students are there in class to learn, but it is a responsibility to keep them attentive while learning. Having a calm state of mind is important because as the music educator, teaching a music curriculum can be a handful and a music educator should be ready for any out of the box questions that students may have. Lastly, a strong music education is essential, because to teach a music class, the teacher should have a solid foundation of music knowledge.</br></br>That said, I strive to become a music educator because of the inspirations in my life, like my father. I am creative, foundational in music, and possess a calm state of mind.

Coming from a speech-impaired perspective, I realized that as I develop into the young woman I am today, I must hide the part of me that contradicts everything I have made myself to be. Maintaining a ninety-six-grade point average, enrolled in honors and advanced placement classes, my grades have always spoken for me. I never had to advocate for myself; until I realized I looked different than my classmates, and that I couldn't rely on the system created to exploit a person like me.</br></br>I started prioritizing office hours and emailing authority, but I realized communication skills and true advocacy lay outside the classroom. Coming into my senior year, mentors saw my involvement in the community and nominated me for student advisory panels. I recently took part in a Community Wellness Summit, an event where members of the community, health specialists, and youth came together to discuss mental health. A youth panel of five (including myself) came together to speak on what mental health means and what can be done to combat and cater to such a complexity.</br></br>As my peers and I led the conversation, I simultaneously gained insight into what I hope to pursue. To create policy that will improve mental wellness, that will lift the fear of the financial burden that healthcare often gives people within marginalized communities. As a member of this panel, I spoke. I spoke through literal stammers and pauses. But I also spoke what I was always used to jotting down. My speaking was more than a speech, more than a transactional practice. My voice spoke louder than the notes on the brochure. I exposed what only my notebook had seen. Although I will always speak with a speech impediment, it no longer serves as a barrier; it is expression without a pen. I realized: writing is the fluency of a voice I have finally mastered.</br></br>My senior year coming to a finish, I continue to find my footing as a community youth advocate. To bring voice to those who believe parts of themselves would impede their progression into the world. From my participation in student advisory panels to being a mental health youth ambassador for Senator Brouk's Roundtable, my pursuits in both policy and film will shine light to the persistent need for change in the many communities I come from.","YGG Ministries (December 2021- December 2023)</br>-working with this ministry group to serve the community for the holiday season</br></br>Community Wellness Summit (November 2023)</br>-volunteering my time on a youth panel of five, using my voice to bring light to the complexity that mental health is",Greece Olympia High School,2024,96,No,No,N/A,AP BIOLOGY,In Progress,N/A,N/A,Health Policy and Administration,Health Policy Analyst,Film Production,Screenwriter,"$10,000 - $50,000",,,-1500,Columbia University,"116th and Broadway New York, NY 10027 United States",Waiting List,St. Josephâ€™s University,"245 Clinton Ave Brooklyn, NY 11205 United States",Accepted,Annette Rouse Memorial Book Award / Essay Contest,Christensen Daniels Scholarship*,Delta Sigma Theta Maude Orman Memorial Scholarship,"Jack & Jill of America, Inc., Rochester Chapter Scholarship",Joan L.

Both for their own personal goals and to make my life easy. I could not go anywhere and say that I've always wanted for things because it simply would not be true. My father has worked a full time job and attended grad schools since I was born, my mother similarly, returning to school and her full time job after I was born. They continued on, up until my junior year as my dad received his Doctorate. Both of their higher educations were received all while raising myself and my two younger brothers. That being said, I don't remember a time when there was not a roof over my head or food in my stomach. In the same light, I can't recall a week where my homework/ classroom progress went unchecked and/or uncelebrated. My parents have instilled the principle of success in me both with the standard they themselves set and the positive practices surrounding my education. They are driven and successful, I aspire to be the same and more.

I intend to attend college, double major in English and Political Science, earn my bachelors, and enroll in law school before getting for a job that I could look to help resolve some of these issues. My upbringing has taught me that so long as I stay driven and ambitious, my goals are attainable and achievable: but drive and ambition alone can't get me there. The education I am striving to have costs. My parents are my prime examples of working hard while paying it off, and their continual work now will cover the cost of my further education partially. I will do my due diligence in making an effort to help sow into myself.
