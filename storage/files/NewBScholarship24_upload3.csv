With graduation looming, my plans are to attend a 4-year University and major in Biology in pursuit on becoming an Orthodontist. <br\><br\>As a young Black male, we are faced with many challenges. I feel it is my responsibility to not be a statistic but be an exception. ThatÕs why I aimed to be a model student and roll model for my peers. I have been a high honor roll student since the 7th grade having a 91.879 overall GPA. Challenging myself by taking accelerated and advance placement classes while also playing a sport and being an active member of several clubs at McQuaid. <br\><br\>Being an Ambassador for the Black Student Union at McQuaid I speak to middle school students about race relations, how words have consequences, and the meaning of brotherhood. I work continuously with administration and other teachers to deal with situations and tensions in the school changing the way, they do and see things at McQuaid for the first time ever. As Captain of my Varsity basketball team, I guide and mentor my new and younger teammates. Speaking positive to build them up when theyÕre feeling down, and to encourage them to do their best not only on the court but in the classroom and community. <br\><br\>I am an active member of the Urban League of Rochester. Attending the National Urban League Annual Youth Leadership Summit in 2022 and 2023 where students come together and engage in transformative learning, leadership, and personal growth. I was the spokesperson for my teamÕs presentation where we placed second in the 2022 Project Ready Case Competition. I am a member of the Urban League of Rochester Youth Leadership Award Selection Committee where I read nominations for each candidate. Nominating two high school students to receive the Youth Leadership Award for the ROC the Future Alliance.<br\><br\>I wish to be considered for a scholarship because of my accomplishments, drive, and perseverance. I am a young man that strives towards success despite obstacles and challenges I face in being my best.

I am excited to submit my application for consideration for this scholarship. I have decided that I am pursuing a Bachelors Degree in Engineering. My interest in Engineering started in 9th grade when a Teacher asked me to consider participating in a program in my High School called Project Lead the Way. Project Lead the Way provided me with exposure in the classroom to the STEM field. I was learning to hook up batteries to small propellers using positive and negative charges. Later I learned to build skills including creating CAD, 3D designs, and Coding. I love the idea of being creative and learning technical skills. I am blessed to have already been accepted to Universities in which I can pursue my goal of becoming an Engineer. I have been accepted to St. John Fisher University (NY), Norfolk State University (VA), and Elizabeth City State University (NC). <br\>I was very active during my High School Career and I was able to maintain a B+ average. In High School, I participated in Mock Trial, Band (Saxophone), Football, Track, Knights Media, and Roc2Change (Social Justice). I am also active in my local Church. Through my local Church, I have participated and volunteered in Youth Programming, Community Events, and Food Drives. Every summer since 9th grade I have worked in my local Recreation Center as a Camp Counselor working with 5-13 year olds. All of these experiences have helped to develop my faith, character, work ethic, community involvement, and career goals.

I looked forward to this trip because it was more than just a getaway to me; it was an opportunity to learn about German culture and refine my performance of the language, which I have studied for several years along with Spanish and Turkish.<br\>In 2019, I auditioned for the Rush-Henrietta Singers, a highly esteemed choir within my district, and have been an active member ever since. As a part of my affiliation with this group, we engage in various community-based projects and humanitarian outreach initiatives. These activities range from caroling at special education facilities and senior centers locally to maintaining a storage facility that provides necessities for families in Ukraine. As someone who is now familiar with the program, I also assume the duty of helping out fellow students who are new to the group in the acclimation process. In addition, I have attended several natural helpers and peer mediation trainings to improve my ability to uplift, support, and counsel those around me. I give back to my community on my own accord as well through volunteering as a school tour guide, face painter, and henna artist. <br\>Participating in social activism has heightened my awareness of societal ills and my civil obligation to advocate for the oppressed. Martin Luther King Jr. stated, ÒThe ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.Ó His words have taught me that sitting idly by as injustice unfolds is the greatest disservice to humanity. The work of Dr. King along with other activists such as Nelson Mandela and Gandhi has compelled me to speak up about the current conflict in Israel; I have attended protests supporting a ceasefire and used my social media platform to spread awareness. Aside from activism relating to foreign affairs, I have also advocated on behalf of my own community. In the summer of 2020, I took part in the ÒGet Your Knees Off Our NecksÓ march in Washington, DC, following the murder of George Floyd. In addition to this, I attended several local protests in my hometown of Rochester, New York. Standing up for what is right continues to be a philosophy of mine that I believe everyone should aspire to live by.",Peer mediation- 3/22-23/23<br\>Rush-Henrietta Singers caroling for town- 8/30-31/22<br\>High School tour guide- 9/22/22<br\>Face Painting at Middle School- 9/16/22<br\>Rush-Henrietta Singers Christmas Caroling for community- 12/10/23<br\>Choral concert usher- 5/31/23<br\>Face painting at middle school- 9/22/23<br\>Orchestra concert usher- 1/17/23,Rush Henrietta High School,2023,4,Yes,No,1340,AP World History,3,AP US HIstory,3,Biology,Anesthesiology,Biomedical sciences,OBGYN,"$100,000 - $150,000",,,,Cornell,"616 Thurston Ave. Ithaca, NY 14853",Application Submitted,University at Buffalo,"12 Capen Hall, Buffalo, New York 14260-1660",Accepted,"Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.

I really appreciated myself for reaching a goal I never thought I could get every quarter for 9th grade. I had a high honor roll and I kept the same consistency and concentration in 10th grade all the way to 12th grade.

I see myself as church-going, although I do not currently go to church. I see myself as outgoing and having love for all people, although I have found others donÕt always love and accept me back. Most importantly, I see me for who I am, regardless of how others see me. I am a 17 year old, church-going, gay black male.<br\><br\>I am told that as a child I did things my own way. One day my grandpa came home to find me walking downstairs, balancing on top of the banister. Each one of my grandmas recognized my uniqueness and independence. They each lived upstairs and downstairs from where my mom and I lived. When Nanny (my one grandma) was at work I would stay with my other grandma (Grandma). Often, I am told, I would walk upstairs to one grandmaÕs or downstairs to my other and rest in her bed. It was not unusual for Grandma to come home asking, ÒDo you know where Lapriest is?Ó, only to be told by Nanny ÒYes, heÕs in your bed!Ó <br\><br\>The center of my huge family are my grandma's hearts. They are what holds our family together. It is because of them that I find connection with people so important. It is because of them that I am not afraid to be out there reaching out to others.<br\><br\>They have also played a role in my Òchurch-goingÓ self. I loved how church got me moving - the music, the prayer. I loved the experience. But there is a part of my church-going self that clashes with my sexuality. In 6th grade I began to transition my way to being out. Grandma is a deeply faithful woman. I was not sure how my identification as LGBTQ would be received by her. But when she found out she said she would accept me for whoever I am. <br\><br\>As far as my culture goes, people tell me that I am an old soul. I have inherited a southern accent from my grandma, even though I grew up in Rochester, NY, I am told ÒYou talk southernÓ, and ÒYou sound like you are from Georgia or North CarolinaÓ. I recently found out that I have family from both states. So I suppose it is my southern roots coming to the surface when I speak. I love Black American food. To me it's more than just food. You have to put your love into that food and there again is where I have found my grandmothers.<br\><br\>I have a really big heart. I have a lot of love for people.

I have demonstrated good connection building skills as Rochester Prep Cheerleading manager. I have also been a senior team member of Chick-fil-A. I have been a leader of the Mentorship Program at Rochester Prep, helping underclassmen. Everyone needs someone to lean on. I donÕt want these kids to grow up having trouble finding that support system.<br\><br\>Being a part of the LGBTQ community for 6 years, I do acknowledge how recognized the LGBTQ community has gotten.

It is set in a fictional state of Michigan where the main character, Macon ÒMilkmanÓ Dead III, an African American, is on a journey to uncover the truth about his familyÕs history and who he really is. Through his journey, he discovers that family isnÕt just about blood ties, but about the relationships and connections we make with others. The bookÕs opening and ending chapters serve as metaphors for the authorÕs themes of identity, family, and self-discovery. The book is a powerful reminder of the importance of taking control of oneÕs life and making oneÕs own decisions. It is about pushing against societyÕs rules and embracing who you are and where you come from in order to achieve freedom and independence.<br\><br\>In the opening chapter of Song of Solomon by Toni Morrison Milkman Dead, is introduced as a little boy who is possessed by the desire to fly. This desire to fly is a metaphor for flight and freedom. Morrison highlights that, Ò Now you know something about yourself you didnÕt know before: who you are and what you areÓ(pg. 104) We see him being born again and growing up in a place where people were living in different parts of the country. We also see how tough it is for the exact purpose of him and his family because of their African-American background. This scene sets the tone for the exact purpose of how race and social issues affect Milkman's life later on in the novel. One of Song of SolomonÕs central themes is the question of racial identity and how it affects peopleÕs lives. The novelÕs title refers to the restrictive nature of race and how it affects the lives of African Americans in a society divided by race. In the first chapter, the weight of these restrictions on the Milkman family is vividly portrayed through vivid descriptions and powerful images.<br\><br\>In the final chapter, however, thereÕs a big change in tone and point of view. ItÕs set in an open field and we see Milkman on a flight, both literally and metaphorically. HeÕs flying high above the ground and discovering a new way of looking at himself and the world around him. The flight symbolizes his freedom from society and his journey towards self-acceptance. This is a pivotal moment in the story of Milkman, as he is freed from these restrictions. The flight is symbolic of his freedom from society and his path to self-discovery. Through this experience, Morrison stresses the importance of finding your own voice, regardless of the pressures or expectations of society.<br\><br\>Another theme that emerges from this juxtaposition is the theme of freedom. At the beginning of the book, we see how the Milkman family is caught up in the trap of their race. They are unable to break free from society and find their freedom. This theme is also highlighted in the last chapter when the Milkman escapes from his home and finds a new sense of freedom. In addition, throughout the novel, Morrison takes us on a journey of self-discovery. The very first chapter of the novel introduces us to Milkman as he struggles with questions about his identity and what he wants to do with his life. In the final chapter, we see Milkman come to terms with who he is, what he wants to be, and where he fits into the world. In these two contrasting chapters, we get a glimpse into the process of self-discovery and how it is important to embrace who you really are.<br\><br\>To sum up, everything that has been stated so far, the contrast between the opening and the closing chapters of Song of Solomon gives Toni Morrison the opportunity to explore some of the most significant themes in the novel. By contrasting themes such as race, liberty, and personal growth, Toni Morrison offers a detailed portrait of Milkman on his path to freedom and self-empowerment.

ÒWhat would it be like to sit in that seat?Ó I would wonder.  My dad is in the Air Force as a flight medic. Every December we would go to airshows and look at the aircraft up close. I would stare into the cockpit and look at the pilots in their uniforms. On family trips I marveled at the views, especially flying over a big city. I also loved the feeling of going to a place I have never been before. <br\><br\>My dad has often asked me ÒWhat kind of life do I want to liveÓ? The kind of life I want to live is one where I am successful and financially stable. But this has not been an easy path.<br\><br\>In 6th grade, I was diagnosed with ADHD. I was a daydreamer. It was harder for me to focus. Experiencing my parents' separation made it even more difficult. Around this time I started taking medication. It made a difference. <br\><br\>Then came high school. I had begun to lose my motivation. I became lazy, and my grades dropped. That was when my dadÕs lectures became more consistent. I struggled with independent work during Covid. Instead of doing schoolwork I was on my phone and game consoles. Dad finally had enough. My phone and game consoles were taken away. My day became about waking up at 7:00 am and hitting the books. <br\><br\>At the beginning of high school, I was confused about what career I wanted to pursue. My first choice was to become a firefighter like Dad. I thought that becoming a firefighter would be easy. I thought Dad  would help me through the whole process. But I didnÕt have a passion for it. At some point I realized that being my best self meant finding my own unique path.<br\><br\>Starting my junior year I realized that if I wanted to be successful, I had to make better choices for myself. My number one goal was to make the honor roll every quarter.<br\><br\>Reflecting on how much I enjoyed being at the airport and traveling made me realize that I wanted to become a pilot.  As I worked to increase my focus, I learned that to become a pilot, I had to stop taking the medication that helped me maintain my focus. I had to prove to myself and others that I could be at my best on my own without the help of the medication. But once I stopped taking the medication it became harder for me to focus on my work in class and to complete my assignments. I realized that I had to put in more effort in order to keep my grades up. So I actively participated in all my classes, and stayed on top of my work. <br\><br\>My hard work eventually paid off. I was able to maintain my grades and stay on the honor roll even without the medication. While exploring my options for college, I decided to major in computer science. When I attend college I plan to maintain focus on my grades and my career goals. My dream is still to become a pilot but I know first I have to get a college degree. <br\><br\>I know the type of life I want, being successful and  financially stable - all the things my dad lectured me about. I also have expectations from family members who have talked to me when I was struggling. They all know that I can do it. But what is more important to me is the idea of having something I can be proud of. I want to pave the way to success for my own satisfaction. Being my best self is something that I am happy to work toward. That is the kind of life I want to live.",,Rochester Prep High School,2024,3,Yes,No,,AP World History,2,AP Computer Science Principles,2,Science and Technology,Commercial Airline pilot,,,"$100,000 - $150,000",,,,SUNY University at Buffalo,"12 Capen Hall, Buffalo, New York",Accepted,SUNY Buffalo State University,"1300 Elmwood Ave, Buffalo, NY 14222",Application Submitted,ESL Charitable Foundation Scholarship*,Manhattan Golf Club Scholarship*,Mary L.

Surrounding me were people, with the same intentions, in the same garments, seeking to purify their soul of past sins.  Everyone was equal. It didnÕt matter if you were black, white or green. Even the homeless were treated with respect. While on this pilgrimage, which is one of the five pillars of my Muslim faith, I saw kids receive food from strangers. The sense of community and the care that people shared for one another was palpable. This experience changed something in me.  <br\>I received my first prayer mat when I was 5 years old, it was green, my father's favorite color, with this velvet texture. I used to watch my parents pray, but I could never understand why or what they were doing. I understood it held value because I would see my parents pray on their mats. I didn't actually know what to do with it at first, but as I got older, I began to understand the importance of prayer and its benefits.<br\>In Islam, we have to pray five times a day. We must set aside time from our day to connect to our Lord with peace and tranquility. In Islam, praying is the second pillar in our belief system, following up on the testimony of faith, which makes you a Muslim. This highlights just how important our prayer relationship is.<br\>After prayer, my second priority in life would be education. Islam teaches us that it is an obligation for every Muslim, man and woman, to pursue knowledge to the highest level and to never stop. In the Quran, there is a verse that can be used as a dua, which is a supplication or request to God: ÒRabbi Zidnee ÔillmaaÓ. In English, this translates to ÒMy Lord, increase me in knowledge."" This Dua helps me keep calm and stay focused. When you learn, you improve your prayer. <br\>Even though I value my prayer mat, there have been times when IÕve stumbled with my faith. For example, after I graduated from the Islamic school I attended, I shifted to a new school where I slowly assimilated to my environment. I became a distraction to myself and the people around me. This led me to make a lot of friends, but I was not using my prayer mat as much. I didn't like this feeling. <br\>Despite periods in my life where IÕve gone astray from my faith, IÕve learned to view my prayer mat as a gateway to keep showing kindness. It has become a safe haven, like a child coming to their mother for comfort. At the end of the day, I see a reflection of myself on my prayer mat. I ask myself if I have treated my friends and family the way they should be treated. I have learned about the power of having a conversation with my God, asking for strength and guidance. When I worry about who I will become and the things I want to achieve, my prayer mat removes that stress and allows me to leave it to God. <br\>After visiting Saudi Arabia, I was reminded of how beautiful our world can be. I realized that I could bring out the joy in other people with acts of kindness. When I came back from my trip, I cleaned the whole house for the first time while my mom was asleep. She saw me following a routine. I was more inspired to do chores around the house - cleaning, laundry, and performing big brother duties, like helping my siblings with their homework.

Getting awards may be fun and exciting. Complements may be sweet. But none of that defines you as a person. The amount of effort that you put in behind the scenes may not be showcased to others. The important thing is to recognize yourself for what you have achieved. You have to give yourself credit because living in someone else's perspective of success is a false sense of reality. <br\>During my junior year, I lost myself when I started struggling to maintain my grades. At this time I was extremely hard on myself. ÒDo betterÓ, ÒBe better Ó, ÒDon't be a failureÓ. This was hard enough. But I also had my mom and grandma on my back. ÒThere's no space for failure in this household Ó, and ÒYou have an example to setÓ was always on my mind. IÕd stay up until 4 a.m. trying to get the work done, knowing my bus came at 6 oÕclock that morning.<br\>After a while, I realized that I was changing a lot. I was drifting further and further away from myself.  Normally I am filled with joy and optimism. But I was losing that. I started thinking to myself  ÒAm I good enough for this?Ó especially when progress reports rolled out and it was time to give awards for hard work. I was used to getting awards, being in the spotlight, and being up on the board. But when that didn't happen I felt worthless.<br\> <br\>During this time I didn't necessarily fall behind but I felt I did. I was very close to breaking the school's discus record in outdoor track. Then I was one track meet away my mother took me out. That experience took me out. I felt I let everyone down. ÒAm I built for this?Ó ÒIs this path really for me?Ó IÕd lay in bed at night thinking. I was just in a spiral until I decided to stop and take a break. <br\>This was a break from being hard on myself. This was a break from all those questions I was asking myself. I started working on personal growth outside of school. I began participating in volunteer work and practicing self-discipline. I started going to church more and connecting with myself on a spiritual level. I went soul searching. It's truly an indescribable feeling. I went through a process of picking out my strong suits and my flaws. I found that I work better with persistence and self-reward. I found out that I am a self-reliant person. I changed my mentality instead of being so competitive and scared of vulnerability, I started asking for help. <br\>I stopped basing everything around school. Once I was done with schoolwork and I was in a secure enough position, I focused more on the experience of living. I learned how to balance out the competitive mindset of school and to give myself  Òme timeÓ - by going out with friends, or playing games. I found my joy and optimism. <br\>I realize now that I am more than my grades no matter how much scolding and self-disappointment I put myself through. I know that I am enough. I know that I'm doing the best I can. I was the one putting in the work and effort, trying to get my curriculum down. That is when my mental health stopped deteriorating.<br\>Experiencing that moment of being so close to one of my goals, then having the opportunity taken away was heartbreaking. But it helped to build my character. You are more than what you think others perceive. In the end, it's your own insight that counts.<br\>In the long run, I see that's how life is. It's a series of tests. I found a way to cope with those hard moments - by soul searching. It builds strength, as you develop guidance for when the next challenge arises.","Mt.

The feeling I get from unique creations is pure excitement. I want to see more. I want to see what more I can do with my skills, and what others are doing with theirs. <br\>It all started happening when I was 14. My first pair of shoes that I really loved were Dunks. I knew I looked good in them. The more I began to look at fashion, the more  interesting it became to me.I  did not want to look like anyone else.. When I walked down the street, I wanted to  stand out from others.<br\>Art was something that came naturally to me. In sixth grade, I discovered I could draw. I would draw whatever was on my mind. After a lesson, I would study tutorials and take whatever knowledge and skill I could develop from them. <br\>As I got into fashion, I researched artists for inspiration. I began to notice more and more creativity online, the trends of folks making their own work: hats, style buckles, hoodies, unisets, sweatsuitsÉ I would play with material and ideas, then watch where that took me. When I showed my family what I made, they would encourage me to go further. Friends would admire my work and say Òyou should take this seriouslyÓ.  <br\>In January 2022 , I started designing my own clothes. I researched and brainstormed the type of clothing to sell and what was popular or trending around the world. One of the first pieces I designed was a hoodie. I made the mockups and design, and used colors that popped off the hood. The colors I used were calm and chill, like an open field of colors of lime green and banana yellow mixed in on a jet background. There was a rhythm to it. The process of creating this for the first time shot a spark through my body, a surge of energy and ideas all at once. I saw that I could do this with my own hands.<br\>Last year I began to study graphic design. I learned how to use Photoshop and Illustrator. I now go home and learn more about how to create through software tutorials. I have also become skilled in Procreate. Now I am in AP Art and Design. I enjoy my classes. If you give me an assignment I will take off with it. <br\>Fashion has helped me develop a reputation for myself.  I have many supporters on social media and in my friendships. Knowing that I will be creating a future for myself motivates me to get up and keep designing, even when I am tired. I know people are waiting for me to create new pieces for them every day. I know that their eyes are on me. <br\>I will also pursue the study of business as a way of using my passion to make a living. Too many businesses fail because of a lack of understanding of fundamental business practices. By studying marketing,  I will have a greater understanding of how to build content that appeals to a wider audience.<br\>I am also committed to learning how to manage money . I want my business to be profitable and enjoy many years of success. When clients seek services, they will know I have a good reputation as a business owner.<br\>Most importantly, I want my business to be a source of motivation for others. I want to set an example for anyone who is in a difficult headspace, to show them that you can manifest your desires by applying yourself to your talents. I want them to see that I have made a future for myself.

IÕm a decent student with a 92 average.  Some of my more challenging classes were AP English, AP History, Honors Physics and Syracuse University Project Advance (SUPA) Sociology.  For as long as I can remember, I've wanted to go to college at the University at Buffalo. I've never known what I wanted to study but I know I want it to be there. I love the idea of a large school that lets me do more on my own but isnÕt too far away from home. Additionally, my cousins live 5 minutes from the campus, so IÕll have a place to go or people to contact if need be. Because my family lives so close, I already know the area well so the college feels like a second home already.  I found out I was accepted in December.<br\><br\>I have a lot of interests and am involved in a lot of different activities.  I have been part of the drama club since the sixth grade and have played roles like King Triton in the Little Mermaid, the Caterpillar in Alice in Wonderland and Thomas Buchanon in The Great Gatsby.  I also play the saxophone in the jazz and symphonic bands, and am co-captain of my High School improv club, Downstage.  I am also a member of the National Honor Society and Student Council.  Outside of school I play CYO Basketball and work part-time at Blitz Sports Bar and Dunkin Donuts.  One of my favorite activities has been Scouting.  <br\><br\>In kindergarten, I joined Cub Scout Pack 362 and from the beginning, I knew I wanted to go all the way.  I went on to join Troop 207 where I've held multiple leadership positions: Quartermaster, Assistant Senior Patrol Leader, Patrol Leader, Senior Patrol Leader and Troop Instructor. Each position taught me how to lead and deal with situations and taught me how to keep order, resolve conflict, and plan for group events. Being in all these roles has really made me appreciate teachers, camp counselors, and anybody who has to take responsibility for copious amounts of kids. And I also know that these experiences will help me in the future, whether it be in the workforce or if I have kids of my own. <br\><br\>In addition to learning leadership, to fund raise and pay for outings, our troop sells wreaths, poinsettias, and Christmas cactuses. In my 7 years of selling door to door, I've sold over $20,000 worth of merchandise. This has completely paid for my yearly dues, every camp-out, summer camps, and two High Adventures Ð Philmont Scout Ranch in New Mexico and Sea Base in Florida.<br\><br\>At Philmont, our group went on a 12-day trek where we hiked over 120 miles and participated in activities like rock climbing, bouldering, musket shooting, and COPE (Challenging Outdoor Personal Experience) activities. I was trek leader, so I had to deal with scheduling and making sure everything went smoothly. Outside of my Eagle Project, it was one of my most fulfilling accomplishments. Sea Base, on the other hand, is an island in the Florida Keys where we had to canoe 5 miles to reach. Once there we went snorkeling, lobstering, and deep-sea fishing (where I caught a five-foot barracuda!).<br\><br\>I also went on to earn the rank of Eagle Scout.  To become an Eagle Scout, I needed to complete 21 merit badges such as personal management, citizenship, and emergency preparedness. Some badges can take months to complete. For my Eagle Project, I organized the construction of picnic tables to create a space in the courtyard for an outdoor classroom, reading area, or lunch overflow. I met with the Principal, Mr. Grow to get approval for the project (which was harder than I thought because Principals are extremely busy).  I got funding from the school and downloaded plans from the internet.  I purchased the materials and got a team to build the tables from scratch. It was great to see the whole project come together.   <br\><br\>As I said earlier, I havenÕt completely decided what I want to study or what field I want to pursue. My main goal is to give myself options, experience a lot, and get a degree because many jobs require one. Plus, since middle school, pretty much every adult in my life would ask, ÒSo what do you think about college?  Have you made up your mind?  What do you plan to study?Ó.  And then they would say ÒPeople change their majors all the time!Ó, ÒCollege is a great place to figure it out!Ó  and ÒYou want to keep your options open!Ó.  It gets confusing!  Either way, the one thing thatÕs consistent is that having a good education is important.  Hopefully, IÕll find a field that I love and a career that IÕm great at.  I canÕt wait to see what the future will bring.","I have been in Cub Scouts and then Boy Scouts since kindergarten.  Community service is a requirement and a big part of scouting.  As a Tenderfoot, I started out only having to do at least one hour of service, but 6 hours or more were required when I reached Star.  Even though we had to complete a minimum amount of hours, our troop would always do more.  Over the years, we have done food drives, planted trees, picked up trash and raked leaves.  Not only did we do good things for the community, we got to have fun while doing it!  My biggest service activity was my Eagle project.  It helped me to become an Eagle Scout and made a big improvement at my former middle school, Johanna Perrin.<br\><br\>To become an Eagle Scout, I needed to complete 21 merit badges such as personal management, citizenship, and emergency preparedness.

This made a lot of sense after COVID forced us to do more things outside and stay farther apart.

I came to school with a purpose everyday and it made me receive so much in return. I say this because IÕve been disciplined ever since I was a young elementary student. It was just so easy for me because IÕve always paid attention within school. IÕve always let my teachers see the works that IÕve done academically and till this day they are all proud of me as a black educated student under the Rochester City School District. ItÕs like IÕve already known what to do when I was told only once to do it. IÕve caught on to everything so fast and I didnÕt even realize it as a young elementary student. However, I received so many academic achievement awards just about in every grade level. Attendance awardsÉalso Honor Roll and High Honor Roll awards. Everytimes on that report card my grandmother would be so proud of me because I really was on the skies for real. Though, my grandmother always told me that school is gonna get harder and harder for for but I really ignored the fact that she mentioned that point. I didnÕt let it bother me because I knew that I was gonna do good with everything. I knew for myself that I could succeed. I didnÕt need my guardian or my teacher to tell me that at all. I just knew. But you know, I wasnÕt just successful academicallyÉ I also was successful in after school activities IÕve done such as basketball and track. Speaking of track, IÕm a very fast distance runner. I was held as captain of the team and actually was a great leader. I inspired both the boys and girls on the team. I even ran far distances with the boys majority of the time. I was just built differently. It was 11th grade last year when I became part of my high schoolÕs Out Door Track team. I can tell you that I was very good and I really found out how impressed my coaches were. It was a time when I ran at a track and ended up coming home with 4 necklace metals for the distances I ran. Usually, I would run a good 800 meter race, a 400 meter, and a 200 meter. IÕm not being cocky or anything but the 100 meter was just too easy for a runner like me. At least I thought it was because I was all about the distance for how fast I can run on a big track. IÕve also done long jumps. I canÕt lie but the long jump was actually fun. It took all my anxiety away from running on those big track fields within those unique high schools. Some were bigger than others but I didnÕt let it stop me from anything at all. I took that heat in the kitchen. IÕm hoping to do track again this  spring of 2024 so I have to start working out again forn it. Moving forward, Basketball is another good sport I love to play even though IÕm not where I wanna be. IÕm actually a track star but I wanna become a superstar in basketball as well. I know itÕs gonna take some training but IÕll make it. Basketball is really fun and super competitive. I love guarding people because it lets my opponent know that IÕm not afraid to do so. Anyways, IÕm really enjoying doing these sports in Wilson High School and IÕm hoping to continue doing this in college. Far as community service, the majority of community service IÕve done was for the people I know in church. The members who know that I love to volunteer would always ask about me doing their yards fast as cleaning it, picking up trash or weeds. I always didnÕt care about the money because I knew that I was going to get blessed anyways regardless of the money. I seriously did it because I love doing it and I know that you canÕt always expect money in return for just helping your neighbors out. Although, the volunteer work was actually my job and the benefits from it kept me from getting a job because I got paid as if it was an actual job. IÕve gotten checks and all from what IÕve done. The work I've done has inspired many people including the ones who didnÕt even know me personally. I set my work out there for everyone to see. As far as future plans, I plan to be a district attorney who works within the criminal justice system.","I've done an Outdoor track in the 11th grade.

I came to school with a purpose everyday and it made me receive so much in return. I say this because IÕve been disciplined ever since I was a young elementary student. It was just so easy for me because IÕve always paid attention within school. IÕve always let my teachers see the works that IÕve done academically and till this day they are all proud of me as a black educated student under the Rochester City School District. ItÕs like IÕve already known what to do when I was told only once to do it. IÕve caught on to everything so fast and I didnÕt even realize it as a young elementary student. However, I received so many academic achievement awards just about in every grade level. Attendance awardsÉalso Honor Roll and High Honor Roll awards. Everytimes on that report card my grandmother would be so proud of me because I really was on the skies for real. Though, my grandmother always told me that school is gonna get harder and harder for for but I really ignored the fact that she mentioned that point. I didnÕt let it bother me because I knew that I was gonna do good with everything. I knew for myself that I could succeed. I didnÕt need my guardian or my teacher to tell me that at all. I just knew. But you know, I wasnÕt just successful academicallyÉ I also was successful in after school activities IÕve done such as basketball and track. Speaking of track, IÕm a very fast distance runner. I was held as captain of the team and actually was a great leader. I inspired both the boys and girls on the team. I even ran far distances with the boys majority of the time. I was just built differently. It was 11th grade last year when I became part of my high schoolÕs Out Door Track team. I can tell you that I was very good and I really found out how impressed my coaches were. It was a time when I ran at a track and ended up coming home with 4 necklace metals for the distances I ran. Usually, I would run a good 800 meter race, a 400 meter, and a 200 meter. IÕm not being cocky or anything but the 100 meter was just too easy for a runner like me.

As I reflect on my personal journey, I strongly believe that I am deserving of a scholarship. My passion and ambition for theatre and culinary arts started at home with my mom. I would like to playwright and be the best chef I can be. This essay will outline my achievements, aspirations, and the unique qualities that make me a deserving candidate for this scholarship. Throughout my academic journey, I have consistently strived for excellence. I have maintained good grades. I have embraced challenges, seeking out advanced courses to expand my knowledge and enhance my skills. My commitment to education extends beyond the classroom as I actively participate in volunteer tutoring programs at my school, Aquinas Institute, I help teach bible learning to the youth at my church, Northridge. I also actively participate and help orchestrate clothing and food drives in my community. This past summer, 2023 I volunteered at a youth camp in assisting kids with disabilities obtain their personal goals. The scholarship would provide me with the financial support necessary to continue my pursuit of knowledge and academic growth, as I have to pay for all of my college expenses myself, a scholarship of any amount would be greatly appreciated. Receiving a scholarship would assist me in not only paying for my education but, giving me motivation to continue earning high grades. Knowing that I have support from an organization and that they want me to succeed with earning my degree would certainly motivate me to keep up my great academic progress. My family is wonderful and has always supported me in whatever I want to do, but my family has never had much money and at some time we have lived from paycheck to paycheck. Growing up in a financially constrained household, I have witnessed the sacrifices my mom made to provide me with a quality education. Her unwavering support and belief in my abilities have fueled my determination to overcome obstacles and excel academically. <br\>I need, and I believe I deserve a scholarship to pursue my passion so I can become great and support myself well and maybe even help support my family. If I get a scholarship to finish college there are many career opportunities I can pursue after I take college classes in theatre and culinary arts. I can be a head chef, play writer, acting teacher, a butcher, a caterer, or I could even do food research and development. My biggest goal right now is to go to college and learn everything I need to learn so I can be the best I can be to pursue my life passion to be a positive role model for my community. The scholarship would alleviate the financial strain on my family, enabling me to focus more on my studies, extracurricular activities, and giving back to my community. In conclusion, my academic achievements, leadership skills, community involvement, and determination make me a deserving candidate for this scholarship. I have consistently demonstrated my commitment to academic excellence, embraced leadership roles, actively engaged in community service, and overcome personal challenges. With gratitude, I humbly request your consideration for the scholarship and hope that you will acknowledge my ability to make a positive impact on the world.",Community Clothing and Shoe drive- September 2024<br\>Youth camp - Volunteer Camp Counselor- assisted kids with disabilities reach their personal goals 2024<br\>Bible Study tutor- 2021-2024 at Northridge Church<br\>Food/ Clothing Drive Holidays- 2020-2024- First Genesis Baptist Church<br\>Student Tutor-- Aquinas 2022-2024,Aquinas Institute,2024,85,No,No,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Culinary,Chef,Theater Arts,Playwright,"$10,000 - $50,000",,,,Binghamton University,4400 Vestal Pkwy E,Application Submitted,Finger Lakes Community College,"3325 Marvin Sands Dr, Canandaigua, NY 14424.",Application Submitted,"Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc.

I scoured the pantry, the cabinets, the fridge, looking for my sneaky condiments. They are nowhere to be found.<br\><br\>You see, I wanted to make yum yum sauce - light, sweet, tangy, with that mouth-watering spicy scent. Standing in my way were two staples: sugar and vinegar. I was faced with a dilemma. Should I throw it out? No, because Mom will kill me for wasting food. That's it then. IÕll have to choke down bland yum yum sauce for the rest of my life!<br\><br\>I snap out of it, because that's ridiculous. Also, this is my favorite sauce of all time. I would marry it! Therefore, I am making this. No matter what. No one will stop me.<br\><br\>The fridge swings open. I grab the only thing I can find: half of a lemon. I sprint back to the pantry, snatch a bear-shaped bottle of honey, juggle both in my now tacky, stinging hands, and tumble them onto the counter. LetÕs begin. The fork clinks rhythmically as the viscous concoction swirls into my vibrant masterpiece. Now for the moment of truth. I go in for the taste.<br\><br\>It was an explosion: honey lemon lighting up my tastebuds mingling with the rich savory notes of mayonnaise, ketchup, and garlic. I could eat it with a moldy boot; it was that good.<br\><br\>Most memorable is the aftertaste. The essence of creativity blooming on my tongue, buzzing at my ketchup-stained fingertips. It coursed through my veins, pulsing to a single conviction: anything I make will be pure magic; anything I attempt I will achieve. What was a simple phrase has become hardwired into my brain, inspiring me to use creativity to convert impossible problems into sensational solutions.<br\><br\>The aftertaste lingers as I gaze upon the school corkboard - hand-sized red and yellow ÒThank You for DonatingÓ cards stapled, then taped around the edges. I volunteered to create promotional materials for a fundraiser called ÒThe Yemen ProjectÓ. I had three days to learn how.<br\><br\>I gave it my all: I designed an array of posters, brochures, and cards. I handed them out to everyone I knew. We exceeded our $250 goal by raising over $700. In front of that bulletin, I felt the ripple of compassion, love, and fellowship traveling through my community and coming back to me. <br\><br\>I couldnÕt stop then. From there, I designed visuals to combat race-based gun violence after the Buffalo shooting, then to open churches in my community, and also to celebrate Black Scholars for the first time at my school.<br\><br\>The aftertaste lingers as I curl into my chair, transforming my vision into reality through code. Since my school doesnÕt provide computer science classes, IÕm creating opportunities to learn it myself. ItÕs not easy to plop yourself in front of a computer after learning, leading, working, doing, every day, but who will show up for me if I donÕt?  I am building the vocabulary that one day will be used to express myself. Multifaceted.<br\><br\>I canÕt stop now. Deconstructing websites and applications, integrating that knowledge into my own; it all invigorates me. I crave learning like my life depends on it, because I know my work will impact the lives of individuals, families, and communities. Starting with this, I am piecing together my future, one line at a time.<br\><br\>It lingered the other day. This time, I tasted orange and brown sugar. I make a lot more than sauces, but that aftertaste gets me every time. My creativity knows no bounds. I revel in its messiness, its uncertainty. I am constantly testing my limits, optimizing my capabilities; it is my driving force. Therefore, how could I not let it bleed into every fiber of my being? <br\><br\>Honestly, there is so much I want to do that itÕs hard to pinpoint. I want to pursue two majors: computer science and graphic design. It encapsulates who I am: a nerdy arts kid with a thirst for knowledge.<br\><br\>First, I want to combat gender and racial bias in technology, not only in the offices but in the code itself. As artificial intelligence becomes more prevalent, the open wounds of systemic oppression reveal themselves, threatening our criminal and healthcare systems worldwide. Artificial intelligence can do extraordinary things for humanity, I want to bring those things to fruition. <br\><br\>Second, I believe coding should be available for everyone. After graduation, I plan on launching computer science programs in under-funded schools.  I've spent six years in a school on the verge of closure and I mourn the unrealized potential of my peers. How are we not preparing our students for the 21st century in 2023? It is unacceptable.<br\><br\>However, nothing sells if it has no visual or functional appeal. Everything that we see is painstakingly crafted for our experience. Apps and websites, products and brands. Design influences every decision. <br\><br\>I want my designs to appeal. Throughout college, I plan on growing my graphic design business. The annual revenue has grown from $100 in 2022 to over $2500 in 2023. I plan on generating $10,000 this year. Whether they influence your buying choices, shape your habits, or challenge your beliefs. I know my designs will make you stop and think.<br\><br\>Science invigorates me, art fuels me. What people neglect is that they need each other. I was made to create. No matter what. With your help, I hope to bring opportunities to future generations, for our humanity, for our world, for our future. <br\><br\>My goal is to graduate debt-free from college. After 4 resuscitation attempts, my father abruptly passed away from heart complications when I was 15. My mother has to shoulder his debt and eventually support two kids in college alone. Every day as ÒLATE NOTICEÓ bills come in, I see the bone-deep exhaustion in her face as she comes home from her second job. She looks at me and always says, ""This is why I tell you to have a good career, so you don't have to go through this"".

Being the first in my family to go to college, receiving a degree honors my parents' efforts in giving me the chances they could never have. It's more than simply a personal achievement. My parents did their best, but funding my education was overwhelming due to financial limitations. When I was a youngster, my parents lacked the resources to create a trust fund or put money away for my education. Nevertheless, their constant confidence in the worth of education and the necessity of perseverance motivated me to achieve despite all obstacles. With a scholarship, I could focus entirely on my coursework and extracurricular activities without worrying about the heavy financial load that comes with going to college. Helping to pay for some of my books, tuition, and other educational costs would free me up to fully enjoy my time in college without worrying about running up massive debt. Furthermore, it would provide access to chances like graduate school or internships that need financial flexibility that would not otherwise be possible. Apart from the instant cash support, being awarded this scholarship would be a concrete acknowledgment of my hard work, dedication, and scholarly accomplishments. It would validate the endless hours I've devoted to my studies, the compromises I've made to manage employment and school, and my strong will to follow my aspirations despite all the challenges I face. My drive to succeed academically and professionally would be reinforced by the knowledge that others see promise in me. Education can change people's lives on many levelsÑnot just for the individual but also for the community and society. This scholarship would help more than just me; funding my education would further the general objective of fostering social mobility and economic opportunity. It would give me the information and abilities I need to influence my profession and positively contribute to my community. Moreover, being awarded this scholarship will allow me to follow my hobbies and aspirations without worrying about money. Through study abroad programs, research opportunities, or internships, I would be free to explore new ideas and chances that would enhance my academic career. In conclusion, receiving this scholarship would help me achieve my academic and professional objectives and give me much-needed financial support. I am convinced that if I am grateful, persistent, and determined, I can conquer any obstacles and make the most of this chance to reach my full potential.",Student-Athlete 2/2020-11/2023<br\>Black Student Union Club Participant 11/2022-06/2024<br\>Class Officer 11/2022-06/2024<br\>Sabrina Lamar Campaign Helper 6/2022-7/2023<br\>School Security Helper 09/2023-01/2024,Joseph C Wilson,2024,96,No,No,,,,,,Psychology,,,,"$50,000 - $100,000",,,,North Carolina A&T State University,"1601 E Market St, Greensboro, NC 27411",Accepted,,,Click dropdown arrow,ESL Charitable Foundation Scholarship*,Keuka College Urban League of Rochester Scholarship*,Little Anderson Morgan Scholarship*,Manhattan Golf Club Scholarship*,"Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority, Inc., Romunda Harris-Fonville Scholarship*","Sigma Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc., Gamma Iota Boule Foundation Scholarship*","Sisters for a Better Black Community, Inc.

I'm a senior in high school and I believe that I should receive the scholarship because of the amount of obstacles and different paths it took me to get to the point of even being a black scholar and accomplished student. This is because even through passive aggressive behavior from multiple faculty members and teachers during my high school career. In addition, while attending a majority white school itÕs been very difficult for me to even get into AP classes when I had a 100 in the class. Teachers felt that the work was too easy for me but wouldnÕt recommend me for the more difficult classes. So pushing myself and taking these classes was also for me but to prove that you shouldnÕt doubt someone just because you believe that they canÕt reach or achieve a certain goal that they have. Next, this experience has also taught me to be more confident especially when it comes to classes when IÕm the only black student or minority in the class at all. The accomplishments that I have received are usually not known by my teachers until they write a recommendation or they see me receive the award which they are usually surprised by and say they never knew about how hard I work or any of my recognitions. Which makes me feel bad and like it doesnÕt matter sometimes no matter how hard I try. Therefore, getting through these obstacles and instead never setting limits on myself has helped me build a serious drive to succeed while reaching my goals.<br\><br\>       Next, this scholarship would help me in the future because of recent events that have occurred in my life. My father who has recently passed away on the 14th of January has been incarcerated since 2019 and my mother during this time has been a single parent working multiple jobs to provide for my siblings and I but also my grandmother. My life feels like a hurricane of emotions right now from college applications to having to express and talk about my emotions dealing with my father with life itself. This is what motivates me to apply for this scholarship because I want to take some of the weight off of her shoulders so she doesnÕt have to worry about me for at least my first year of college. The scholarships would also help limit the amount of work I have to do outside of school while also being a S.T.E.M major who wants to become a future cardiologist. The Black Scholar program has helped me show my younger siblings and cousins that through hard work and balance in school youÕll be recognized even if your school doesnÕt. Therefore, this scholarship will help me be more financially stable and open my availability for other studies and self care.<br\><br\>       In conclusion, I believe that I should be a successful applicant because I will use this scholarship to my advantage for my future and when choosing my college or university this year. Additionally, this scholarship will show that hard work pays off and that the days of crying and little to no sleep were worth it. Finally, this scholarship is an amazing opportunity and I would love to be a representation for future applicants.",Administrative tasks at FoodLink on January 18<br\>Special projects at FoodLink on January 23<br\>Donating cans for food drive at Athena on January 18<br\>Helper for Athena CareÕs on December 19<br\>Assistant for Equity Club in January 15-24<br\>Camp consumer for P.A.S.T.A camp in July 24-29<br\>Director during SEL for February 14<br\>Interpreting for Black Excellence event on February 15,Greece Athena High School,2024,4,No,No,,AP English and Composition,4,AP US History,3,Biology,Cardiologist,Business,Real estate,"$50,000 - $100,000",,,,Emory University,"201 Dowman Dr, Atlanta Georgia",Application Submitted,University of Rochester,"Rochester ,NY",Application Submitted,Black Scholar Endowment Fund Scholarship*,Christensen Daniels Scholarship*,Excellus Blue Cross Blue Shield Community Excellence Scholarship*,Fletcher & Mildred Smith Memorial Scholarship*,Greater Rochester Health Foundation Scholarship*,"Joseph R.

For example, ArgentinaÕs Matanza River is polluted by American companies. The citizens in this area lack clean drinking water and suffer from respiratory diseases, rashes, and cancer. Similarly, American landfills cause health issues for impoverished residents living near them.<br\>Even in the United States, African Americans are disproportionately affected. The impact that Hurricane Katrina had was intensified due to climate change. After the hurricane, the mortality of African Americans was much higher compared to white Americans, African Americans lost more jobs, and African Americans lost more homes and many were unable to rebuild them.<br\>This past summer, I was selected to attend a two-week program at Cornell University: Sustainable Summer.This program involved interactive classes, debates between peers, and presentations. I gained much knowledge on energy efficiency, and I conducted a survey related to sustainability. The survey results indicated that many people would like to reduce their carbon footprint and live a sustainable lifestyle, but donÕt know where to start and feel it takes much effort.<br\>              I concluded from this experience that individuals need greater access to information so that they will be more inclined to join the battle against climate change and work toward sustainability.  <br\>	So, with a college education and degree in environmental science and policy, I will be fully prepared to tackle the issues of climate change in our world. I dream of going to law school after graduating from undergrad so I will be able to advocate for new policies and laws protecting our environment in a legal setting. <br\>Climate change isnÕt just an issue of global temperatures increasing. It is also an issue of classism and racism. I believe that if we look at climate change from this perspective, we will be able to achieve true change. Receiving a college education will give me the knowledge and insight I need in order to truly make a difference in our world and to make it a better place.","I was the a youth volunteer for Malik EvansÕ mayoral campaign between May-June of 2021<br\><br\>Through June-Late July of 2022, I volunteered with the Harriet Tubman Bicentennial Celebration in Rochester and acted, danced, performed in skits and plays, provided instruction and enrichment for children and taught them about black historical figures<br\><br\>Helped with the organization for the Ugandan Water Project's 5k marathon on 04/15/23<br\><br\>Created a poster for the Climate Solutions Accelerator to use at events throughout April of 2023<br\><br\>Volunteered with the Atlanta Community Food Bank on 07/17/23<br\><br\>Volunteered with the ABOVE Organization for the Pan African Festival on 08/05/23<br\><br\>Helped to box up food for families for Thanksgiving on 11/17/23<br\><br\>Helped the children in the Rochester chapter of Jack and Jill Inc. to create Christmas baskets and give them  out at Plymouth Gardens on 12/01/23<br\><br\>Tabled outside of Greece Ridge mall with the Climate Solutions Accelerator to talk to people about climate change on 12/09/23<br\><br\>As an AP Spanish student, I helped to tutor younger Spanish students at my school before their midterms from January 15-19th",Our Lady of Mercy High School for Young Women,2024,431,No,No,,AP United States History,3,AP Language and Composition,3,Environmental engineering,Environmental engineer,Environmental science and policy,Environmental lawyer,"$50,000 - $100,000",,,,Cornell University,"Ithaca, NY 14850",Application Submitted,University of Pittsburgh,"4200 Fifth Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15260",Accepted,"Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.

As the oldest daughter and a big sister I naturally lead by example and do everything responsibly. As a child I brought home awards for star student and honor roll which is a performance I continue today. While being a junior in high school I became a part of the NeuroEast program that my school has with the University of Rochester and was able to experience a very skilled high tech work environment. This opportunity taught me attention to detail in the lab and how to perform various forms of scientific procedures all while exposing me to a new side of the scientific world. I was able to attain a plethora of skills and some of my work was presented in my lead Investigators presentation with my name as a co-author at a national Neuroscience Conference in Washington, DC during 2023. The following school year in 2023 from 2024 I joined HOSA, or what used to be known as Health Occupations Students of America, and became vice president. As a group we learned and taught each other medical skills that we were able to show off in the national competition to show other students in or outside of our school that with confidence and teamwork it's possible for them to receive a memorable award at any age. Outside of school I like to volunteer at animal humane society shelters, make my own jewelry, and build legos.

Growing up my parents always said that I had to work much harder than others in order to find and receive those same opportunities that they did naturally. My parents have always held this value close and encouraged me to follow, especially because my parents were brought up with little care for education or passion for pursuing a higher education. And I can say with full gratitude that their teachings have been successful, for both my older sisters have received, as I plan to, a higher education.<br\><br\> My siblings and I always pushed ourselves to take challenges, especially when it came to education. To learn as much as possible and look into a world of different topics and questions so that we may become the best holistic and educated versions of ourselves.

I struggled in some of my higher level classes, such as AP Chemistry. However, through this challenge I was able to grow and become more resilient in my everyday life. The struggles and success I faced pushed me to do things that were harder and keep going for what I wanted, even if it seemed impossible. <br\><br\>Receiving the scholarships would allow me to focus on my education and not have to worry constantly about the price of it all.

Even though some adults told me to quit and or try this class or another class again next year. I still preserved and learned lessons in a scaffolded way, finished up months of classwork and assessments from those months of being absent, in a matter of weeks, spent time after school to catch up, and went to my dance classes in the evening.  I had to prove to myself and those around me, that ""I got this!""  I refused to let the feeling of regret take over.

Next, I am an honor roll student with a current GPA of 3.7 on a 4.0 scale. I attend a suburban school where I am ranked in the top 80 out of 300 hundred of my peers. Also, I have been an Early Recognition of the Black Scholar Award, from the Urban Black League, every year I have been in high school. I have also, received an award for Algebra II in my 11th grade year scoring the highest in my grade level. Lastly, I am involved at my church, Glory House International, I do community service and I work part-time while maintaining my GPA. I have proved that I can work hard in the classroom and outside of the classroom no matter who doubted me. My mother has always pushed me to become the person I am, as well as the family around me. Overall, I have been taught nothing worth having is easy and that if thereÕs something that you want you must work hard for it.","¥ Gate Keeper and SOW- church greeters and help out in children's ministry<br\>July 2022- present <br\><br\>¥ Project Cradle Care- packing bags for NICU families: <br\>Feb. 2024 <br\>Feb. 2023 <br\>Feb. 2022<br\><br\>¥ Toy Drive- giving out toys to those in need:<br\>Dec. 2023<br\>Dec. 2022<br\><br\>¥ Reading- read to elementary students<br\>Dec. 2023<br\>Dec. 2022<br\>Dec. 2021<br\>Dec. 2019<br\><br\>¥ Helping the homeless- hand out hats, gloves, and soup/chili<br\>Nov. 2023<br\>Feb. 2023<br\>Nov. 2022<br\>Nov. 2021",Gates-Chili High School,2024,370,Yes,No,980,,,,,Music Production,Music Producer/Engineer,,,"$50,000 - $100,000",,,,Bowie State University,"14000 Jericho Park Rd, Bowie, MD 20715",Accepted,Buffalo State College,"1300 Elmwood Ave, Buffalo, NY 14222",Accepted,"Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc.

A child on the back of her grandmother being moved from place to place without any idea. Hearing the death of her beloved friend, tears seemed to have dried like the Euphrate river. Her tears weren't the only thing that dried up. The blood of her friend also dried up when running from war. Skinny as if she hadnÕt touched any food in her life. The only music to her ears was the sound of gunshots, BANG! BANG! BANG! What a blood-curdling rhythm that makes you want to dance in fear. As she stared at the dark ceiling, no thought, just a question. Why did the world abandon me?     <br\>        Did the world really abandon me? Although there wasn't any winter in Congo, the coldness was still felt within the heart. She was just a young child and yet her mind felt like the mind of an old lady. She was fine, or so she thought. The trauma and the world's shadow was still lurking. My life story being told in 3rd person gives me a bit of a glimpse within my heart. This shows how blessed I am because I am still alive today to be able to tell my story As a narrator. The first time I ran from Democratic Republic of Congo. I was only 5 years old, even at that age I remember most things. It was like a generational tradition for my family to run from war. As long as I can remember my country was mostly at war so we took refuge in other countries. The night was always warm even when people screamed in herror the warmth was always there. The cruelty of sun was unimaginable bringing the heat and even left it marks. As my daily routines I layed covered in my blanket. The world was dancing with a unique rhythm instead of laughing people were crying, screaming, and shouting. Being wrapped on my grandmother's back, she cried and cried. All I could hear was her shouting. I wondered if she was shouting for help, or if she lost a loved one. It was only the death of one of our leader who died, he enjoyed the luxurious life of being a leader and ripping the wealth of its people while they live below a dollar. Bam! I fell to the ground the first time I was hospitalized at the age of 6.  My grandmother was crying as if I had died, the only thing I could do was laugh as I called her mom. She fed me a spoonful of rice porridge and magically I got better. What a blessing. This was just the beginning of my life story. Finding out my grandmother wasnÕt my mom, and having to travel to meet my mom. From then on, my life story started taking a different turn.<br\>        My mom was young looking and she could be mistaken for my sister. I lived in Zambia for a few years. After a while, We got called by the refugee organization to come to America.  My face lit up as if it was face to face with the sun, my heart bounding as if time had stoped. That day I thanked the cruel sun that never seem to care about anyone else but itself, maybe the sun wasnÕt all that cruel maybe it only wanted to comfort me and distract me from whats happening. I had many dreams and hopes to be educated and change my country such as being a nurse and a lawyer. America was the land of opportunity for an immigrant child. It a tool one use to achieve their golas and dreams. Living in America, I had to relearn a lot of things, such as cultural differences and norms. It was now time for me to experience things That I onced only dream about. My first time experiencing luxury was when I first tried ice cream. The creamy taste, and the cold effect left by the ice lingering on my tongue, the brain freeze from eating it too fast, and the amazement. Some say once you have a taste of luxury you crave it more and you become greedy. My second luxury was a warm bed that felt so cozy especially during the harsh winters and a heater in the house. Although the coldness of Rochester made me miss the sun that I once frowned upon, and I would laugh at the thought it it would easily melt the ice cream before I get to eat it. some may say why mention ice cream first instead of a bed,  When I was little I went to my neighbor's house and they had a small tv that everyone in the village would come and watch on, I saw a kid try white stuff that looked like the clouds, and i wonder if they were the clouds or did they only resembles eachother. the way my face lit up as I also tried it for the first time. My biggest luxury is living in a nice home with tv and being able to go to school with the material being handed to me such as textbooks, pens, and chromebook. This was such a luxury. IÕm eternally Greatful to God for giving me an opportunity in life that most kids in my village didnÕt get. IÕm also great to his merful show of love. <br\>        While others may argue that the things I listed arent luxury as someone who grew up in poverty and sometimes had to skip a meal. Having a meal everyday and a safe home is such a luxury. Although this is my new luxury. Let me tell you about my luxury of poverty is a built discipline. My luxury of poverty is that it made me appreciate small things. My luxury of poverty is that life taught me a lesson and hard work. Poverty is deemed as bad, but for me I view it as a pleasure and a luxury to experience poverty because it taught me a lot of things. IÕm eternally grateful to my life experiences that shaped me as a person, and to the world that never abandoned me.",Track set up and clean up.          2022<br\>Raking leaves for people            2023<br\>Campus cleaning                       2023<br\>Church babysitting                     2023,Greece Odyssey High School,2024,85,No,No,,Ap world history: Modern,2,Ap seminar,2,Nurse,Pediatric nurse and Labor nurse,Lawyer,Human right lawyer,"$50,000 - $100,000",,,,Yale,"New Haven, CT 06520",Application Submitted,Keuka college,"141 central Ave, Keuka park, NY 14478",Accepted,Addlife,Christensen Daniels Scholarship*,"Sigma Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc., Gamma Iota Boule Foundation Scholarship*",William McKnight Memorial Scholarship / Nixon Peabody LLP / Rochester Area Community Foundation (April 8),Joan L.

Growing up, my parents were always the oldest of all the parents in my classroom. I hated it. Still, I was always daddyÕs little princess. When I was younger my dad and I would do everything together. We would take long car rides to random destinations, getting food at new restaurants, going to secret beaches, and staying there forever, everything under the sun. I often think that because they were older, they were more relaxed. More chill. But, for many reasons, being the child of an older parent can have horrible consequences. <br\><br\>Up until I was 10 my life was normal, I had a normal family life, we would eat dinner together, my mom and my dad could drive me to school together, we could go on family vacation together, we would do everything together. Until one day in 2016 my parents had this huge family meeting a with the whole entire family, aunts, uncles, cousins, siblings, nieces, nephews, I had never seen so many of my family members standing in my living room together ever. My parents sat at the front of the living room with long faces, and I started to get a nasty feeling in my stomach. They settled the family down then started talking about why they had brought us all there that day, they were speaking for about twenty minutes when I heard my mom utter the words, ÒPaul has stage 4 bladder cancerÓ. The room around me became nonexistent, every person's voice in that room became a blur of tv static and fuzz. Never in my ten short years of life had I ever felt the feeling I had that day. My father was the world to me. He was my biggest fan and I didnÕt know how I could exist without him.  <br\><br\>So, I did what brought me comfort and securityÑI performed. Growing up performance was always a huge part of my life, whether it be putting on a musical in the living room to being a part of one on stage. The stage truly holds my burdens. When I am on, the stage I can put every emotion I am feeling into the performance. Once I hit that stage nothing is in my way, and I can just fly free like an angel soaring through the sky. My dad would always be at my performances, every time he came, I knew the show would go amazing because he is my partner in crime, and everything was okay when dad was there. but because of doctorÕs appointments, severe health scares and emergency surgeries, I realized my father was becoming too weak to even make it out of the house, let alone come to a show. I remember the first show he couldnÕt attend because of a surgery, and I was completely sick to my stomach. I didnÕt know if I would ever see him again after that show  Instead of hurting for a loss that hadnÕt happened, I performed for him, as if he was still in that front row. He is the reason that I always know to keep going.","Irondequoit Chorale's Broadway Concert- Guest soloist, 2023<br\>Eastridge Vocal Soloist- The National Anthem, 2022, 2023<br\>Eastridge Vocal Concert Soloist for Tzur YIsrael and Makabongwe, 2022<br\>NYSSMA Solo Festival, 2022<br\>Eastridge Vocal Performance Showcase, 2021",Eastridge High School,2024,79,No,No,,,,,,Theatre,Performing Arts/ Musical Theatre,Musical Theatre,Performing Arts/Musical Theatre,"$10,000 - $50,000",,,,MONROE cOMMUNITY COLLEGE,"1000 E HENRIETTA RD.

As a lawyer, he has a million reasons as to why the situation was due to my carelessness, even though it would never have happened if he would have thrown the pin away.Ê <br\><br\>That day, I learned to not only wear my slides around the house at all times so that I donÕt end up with another pin in my foot, but I also discovered that pain and adversity can strike you when you least expect it. When you face a challenge, all you can do is accept it, fight through it, and move on with life.Ê That is what I have done ever since Òmy pin incidentÓ- accept the pain and adversity in my life and keep moving forward. <br\><br\>I look at my mother, who is fighting an incurable disease that forced her to retire from being an attorney at 34 years old.Ê I watch my father, take care of her, myself and my three siblings while he also manages his own law firm.Ê They have not let adversity stop them.Ê Just like them, I will not let adversity stop me from succeeding.<br\><br\>Their examples inspired me to join my schoolÕs track team.Ê I can admit that I am not the fastest person ever, and that some of my peers laugh at that fact. But in spite of this, I didnÕt let their criticism bring me down and I continued to participate in track meets. I pushed through the pain in my strained legs, and my tears, and crossed the finish line after each race.Ê Little by little, as the season progressed, I began to improve and soon became a much better runner. <br\><br\>During my sophomore year of high school, I was diagnosed with a gastrointestinal condition called Eosinophilic Esophagitis.Ê I have to admit that it was terrifying learning that I had this condition, out of nowhere.Ê That I now had a condition that would force me to regularly visit my doctor, take medication, and require me to spend time in the hospital when I should be in school, heavily affected my mental state.Ê I often was behind on my assignments due to this new change in my life.Ê Even so, I didnÕt let this disease keep me from obtaining good grades and enjoying my life. I pushed myself to work twice, if not three times as hard as I did before, not only in order to keep my grades up, but to make my grades exceptional. I pushed to not only make myself proud, but also please my family and relieve their worries about me.<br\><br\>Time and time again, I have faced pain and adversity in my life. Whether it be a pin in my foot, running in track meets despite being ridiculed by my friends, or being diagnosed with a disease that prevented me from school attendance at times, adversity has never stopped me.<br\><br\>That is why I know I will succeed in college and in life afterwards.Ê Each challenging experience is just a little bit of pain, and a little bit of adversity in the moment.Ê I know itÕs just a setback and most of all I know I wonÕt let these challenges break me.<br\>***<br\>Although at first glance our householdÕs adjusted gross income appears to be high, my parentsÕ ability to help me financially with my education costs is severely limited.

Excited because I am going to the best country in the world and sad, and nervous because I'm going to leave my mum, go to a new country, and discover a new language. <br\><br\>My name is Amadou Oulen Nabe and I was born in Guinea, West Africa. My first language is French, but I also speak Spanish and right now IÕm learning and improving my English. My strongest trait is that I never give up on what I want in life. <br\><br\>I am an only child and my dad passed away in October 2008. I grew up with my mom. Life was not easy for us since my dad passed away. My mom had no formal education and struggled to get a job. She worked as a maid and saved every penny to start a little business selling things like deodorant and beauty products.Ê I worked alongside her, helping her to find customers. We worked hard, but it was not enough. She made the difficult decision to send me away. She did everything in her power to give me a good education, even sending me out of the country without her.Ê She inspired me to never give up. I hope I will be with her very soon in the future. <br\><br\>I left my country in April 2022 to arrive in the United States in June 2022. It was not easy to get here because I came as a migrant. I went through several countries such as Cuba, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, and Mexico on buses. It was hard because at that time I did not speak any Spanish or English to communicate with people, I was always using Google Translate.Ê I arrived in Arizona and had to stay in a minor detention facility for nine months. ThatÕs where I learned Spanish. In the detention facility, most of the kids and workers were Spanish people so I spent most of my time listening to them talk and trying to understand. Also, I watched movies in Spanish with French subtitles so that I could learn the language and have friends to talk to. I was allowed two phone calls per week to call my mother in Guinea. I was so happy every time I spoke with her.ÊÊÊ <br\><br\>I can quickly adapt to a multitude of situations and like to take on challenges. Furthermore, one of the reasons for my coming here is to find a good academic environment, college, and sports education to be able to realize my dreams and to help my family and friends.Ê I am good at sports, especially soccer.Ê I started playing when I was 5 years old. I played for a lot of teams in my country.Ê Unfortunately, I had knee reconstruction surgery in July, so I wonÕt be able to play this year. It hurts me to see my friends play without me but I have no choice. I hope to recover and be able to play next year for my college soccer team.<br\><br\>I am good at math, it's my favorite subject, and that's why I want to be an engineer in the future.Ê I like the idea of being able to solve problems for myself, my family, and my community.Ê I like relying on my brain to fix the issues that we face.<br\><br\>I hope that I will accomplish my goals or dreams with the help of all the people around me like my family, my friends, and my teachers.Ê I am sure this country will allow me to be successful.",Student ambassador for New student who speak French and Spanish    November 2023- Present,East High School,2024,92,Yes,No,,,,,,Civil Engineering,,,,"$10,000 - $50,000",,,,Monroe community college,215 Magee Ave,Intend to Apply,Clarkson University,215 Magee Ave,Accepted,"Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc.

I knew I wasnÕt in the best academic setting and IÕm forever grateful that my parents supported and trusted me in the transition.   I went from going to this suburban school to this city school. The whole time I was going to this school I didn't really know anybody at the school and it didnÕt feel like home and I was only going there because my parents liked me going there. I had to convince my parents to let me transfer schools. And after a lot of convincing my dad and mom came to an agreement to let me switch districts. Leading me to transfer to the same school my mom graduated from and the school was closer towards home. This move was made right before my junior year of high school. But while I was going to the school it was during quarantine years which meant I had school only two days a week due to their own hybrid system the first year and it didnÕt really help me feel comfortable there. Half of the school had school Monday and Thursday and the other half had school Tuesday and Thursday. I had played sports there so I had made friends due to sports, and had friends that went there so I wasnÕt by myself and had people to talk to. But besides the friends I had known before I went there I didnÕt really talk to anybody. And in group activities I didnÕt really talk to my peers and I would just sit there and be awkward. But being an athlete you make friends on your team that you talk to everyday. So in school I would talk to teammates in school and make mutual friends throughout football which I have done my whole life. But when I switched schools I didnt have to force myself to talk to anybody. Everything at school felt natural. I felt like I had been there forever. I had enjoyed going to school more than I did in previous years due to the connections I had built with my peers, teachers, counselors, and coaches in the short time I was there.  I felt more confident in myself through these connections and will be forever grateful my parents believed in me.",,East High School,2024,4,Yes,No,1000,,,,,Exercise science,Counselor,Buisness,NFL,"$10,000 - $50,000",,,,Southern Connecticut State,"501 Crescent St, New Haven, CT",Click dropdown arrow,,,Click dropdown arrow,"Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc.

The empty chair at the table from the time my dad went to the streets of Ferguson for what felt like forever.<br\><br\>Community.  It isnÕt just an idea: it's what I was born into.<br\><br\>When you are surrounded by people addressing the inequities in your community, it teaches you a lot.  It wasnÕt just my parents I saw doing this, either. I also witnessed it in my 6th grade teacher Mr. Cannon, who made all of us feel connected and excited.  He used popular rap songs and remixed them to correspond to what we were learning.  He gave us tools to make our own mini-documentary about community issues we cared about, and he made learning relevant. He pushed us. This is the type of learning experience that every student in our district needs and deserves. <br\><br\>But community can be shattered.  Mr. Cannon was one of the dozens of teachers who got a pink slip in December 2019. Our district had mismanaged millions, and because of their irresponsibility, he would be without a job before the school yearÕs end.  And the students who had benefited from the community he helped us build were left to pick up the pieces. Angered by the entire situation, students from all across the district took action.<br\><br\>It started as a walkout -- I don't think any of us expected it to go as far as it did. During the walkouts, we heard from the community and listened to stories from students and parents who had been impacted by the corrupt system. We rallied for change, and we also rallied around each other. We raised each other's energy, found joy despite the hurt, and took charge in a system where the ones directly affected are the last to be heard. Through the passion and pain that came from losing teachers, we felt that we needed to do more, we needed to learn more about the inequities of the past, so that we could be informed about how we could make change.<br\><br\>We listed our demands: diverse teachers that would represent the student body, nutritious and palatable food, the need for restorative practice over punishment, and no more one-size-fits-all learning experiences. This meant access to a range of courses and programs, as well as adults who would support us in whatever those opportunities were. Through tenacity, we got many of our demands addressed; however, we are still fighting for some including that last demand for access to more opportunities. <br\><br\>Many people talk about how we need to create more resources and opportunities for the youth but at least in my community, that's not the problem. There are a tremendous number of programs and I have been lucky enough to have been raised to be proactive, allowing me to take advantage of these. Unfortunately, not all students have people in their lives encouraging them to go out and find programs in which they would thrive.<br\><br\>There's a disparity, and it's not just between suburban and city schools; there's a disparity between those embraced by a community like mine and those who are lacking that love and encouragement in their life. In all the work I've done and opportunities I have had, if there's one thing I learned, it's that advocating is my passion and I believe working in a high school is my calling and place to do that. I know these issues will not change overnight but I do know I have a role in fixing them.  I believe in the importance of my voice and the value of my contributions to this world, and I want every future student to believe the same about themselves.","Student Volunteer, School Board Campaign, 2023<br\>Student Assistant, East Lower School, 2022<br\>Teacher Assistant, School #28 and School #58, 2022",East High School,2024,419,Yes,No,1310,AP Government and Politics,4,AP Psychology,4,Math Education,Secondary Math Teacher,Psychology,School Counselor,"$100,000 - $150,000",,,20436,Howard University,"2400 6th St NW, Washington, DC 20059",Accepted,Jackson State University,"1400 John R.
