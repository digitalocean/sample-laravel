<p>I'm Salah Mohamed, the Nazlawi Business College Chairman, and it is my pleasure to be part of such a diverse and progressive College of Specialist Accountants.</p>
<p>Although we&rsquo;re a relatively young organization we&rsquo;ve achieved a lot in a short time. Since our formation we&rsquo;ve grown steadily, and gained Recognition Status with Ministry of higher education in Republic of Sudan .</p>
<p>We are a college of Professional Membership and Awarding College dedicated to the support of Accountants around the world. We believe in the equality of all human kind, and the free spirit that drives us all to follow our dreams. We believe that we all have the potential to achieve great things; whether those achievements are simply personal goals, or globally recognized accomplishments, they can be realized. Nazlawi Business College &nbsp;provides the vehicle for personal growth and development, but you provide the vision, desire, determination and dedication to turn dreams into reality.</p>
<p>Below is one of my favourite quotes, which I think describes the Nazlawi Business College &nbsp;Ethos perfectly&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To accomplish great things, we must not only act, but also dream; not only plan, but also believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;...Anatole France 1844-1924.</p>
