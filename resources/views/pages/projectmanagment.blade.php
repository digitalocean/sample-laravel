                         <p><strong>What is Project Management..?</strong></p>
<p>Project Management is about the efficient and successful control of change within an organization. It is the discipline of planning, organizing, securing, managing, leading, and controlling resources to achieve specific outcomes.</p>
<p>Projects are temporary operations with strongly defined stages controlling the start-up, execution, and closure of change events. The temporary nature of projects contrasts with the on-going nature of Business-As-Usual, which is repetitive, usually permanent, and is geared up to support the delivery of products and services of the organization. The skills and qualifications required by project management are usually quite different from those required to manage Business-As-Usual activities. Good Project Managers are a critical factor in the effective management of change, which is needed to bring success to any organization.</p>
<p><strong>How does Nazlawi Business College support Project Management..?</strong></p>
<p>In order for any organization to ensure that its projects are being implemented and managed effectively it needs to have access to highly-skilled project professionals who understand all aspects of project management. It also needs to be certain that the Project Management it engages view the projects with an organizational perspective rather than considering the projects in isolation.</p>
<p>Being an effective Project Manager requires more than simply understanding Project Management methodologies. It requires the Project Manager to empathize with the organization and to understand what the organization is trying to achieve long-term and the impact of the projects that it is undertaking. Organizations therefore require project managers to take a holistic approach to projects, and in particular pay close attention to matters beyond the day-to-day management of the project such as; Project Governance, as well as Business-As-Usual activities.</p>
<p>Nazlawi Business College provides the environment to enable people to become skilled in the subjects that are required to perform effectively as Project Managers. We provide a structured set of Assessments that enable you to target your learning towards the topics that are required to become a competent Certified Project Manager. Upon completion of the Nazlawi Business College CPM Assessments you will be regarded as competent to manage projects of any size, in-line with the ANSI standard in Project Management known as ANSI/PMI 99-001-2008. In addition, you will be able to take comfort in the knowledge that you have achieved a qualification that has been approved in the Republic of Sudan by the Higher Education since 2016. You will also have gained a valuable international qualification that is supported by an organization that is dedicated to all aspects of Project Governance as well as Project Management.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alongside is a diagram which illustrates the combination of Exam Award Units that are included in the Certified Project Manager (CPM) qualification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both of the Exam Award Units must be passed before you can gain the CPM Certificate.</p>
<p>By achieving the &ldquo;Project Management (3.2)&rdquo; Award Unit you will have demonstrated a thorough and in depth understanding of the generic study of Project Management. In addition; by completing the &ldquo;PM Body of Knowledge (3.3)&rdquo; Award Unit you will have further demonstrated an in-depth understanding of the ANSI standard, which now governs modern Project Management, and you will have developed a comprehensive appreciation of the Framework, Knowledge Areas, Tools and Techniques required to effectively be involved in Projects in a modern organization</p>
